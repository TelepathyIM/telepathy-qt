/**
 * \page async_model Asynchronous Object Model
 *
 * \section async_model_overview Overview
 *
 * Telepathy-Qt4 uses <a href="http://dbus.freedesktop.org">D-Bus</a> to
 * communicate with applications implementing the
 * <a href="http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/spec.html">Telepathy
 * specification</a>.
 *
 * When dealing with D-Bus, method calls can take some time to return,
 * and in this case is not desirable to make synchronous calls,
 * which could turn into applications hanging waiting for method returns.
 * In order to avoid this issue, all Telepathy-Qt4 high-level methods requiring
 * D-Bus method calls will return a \link Tp::PendingOperation \endlink which will
 * emit a signal \link Tp::PendingOperation::finished() \endlink when the operation
 * has ended. See individual methods' documentation for more details.
 *
 * Additionally Telepathy-Qt4 introduces a concept model in which object features need
 * to be enabled before usage. Information corresponding to enabled features can be inspected
 * synchronously with no need for asynchronous D-Bus method calls and the associated
 * programming complexity.
 *
 * To avoid the complexity of doing asynchronous calls when making object features ready
 * Telepathy-Qt4 also provides so called factories for the main objects.
 * These object features can be enabled by constructing a corresponding factory and enabling the
 * desired features, and passing these factories to the objects responsible for creating
 * the objects whose features are required.
 * Doing that, applications are guaranteed that the specified features are ready in objects
 * signaled to them by the library.
 *
 * However, if a particular feature is only ever used in a specific circumstance, such as an user
 * opening some settings dialog separate from the general view of the application,
 * features can be later enabled as needed by calling becomeReady() with the additional
 * features on the object, and waiting for the resulting PendingOperation to finish.
