Fixes:
 * Fixed illegal C++ statement in one of service interfaces.

telepathy-qt 0.9.6 (2015-05-15)
=================================

The "New blood" release.

Enhancements:
 * Added TP_QT_VERSION and TP_QT_VERSION_CHECK macros
   - Can be used like #if (TP_QT_VERSION == TP_QT_VERSION_CHECK(0, 9, 6))
   - Absence of the TP_QT_VERSION macros indicates previous versions
     (might be useful for service bindings compatibility)
 * Added client side support for conference calls

API changes:
 * Refactored service-side bindings API
   - BaseConnection createChannel() and ensureChannel() methods
     now accept request map instead of several extracted values.

telepathy-qt 0.9.0 (2011-12-20)
================================

The "Merry Christmas" release.

This release begins the new 0.9 development series for feature additions
following the 0.8 stable release series.
Starting with this release the project is renamed to telepathy-qt (TelepathyQt) and
Qt5 support is added alongside Qt4 support and for that 0.9 will be
API (see changes below) and ABI incompatible with previous versions.

API changes:
 * Everything containing qt4 (with or without caps) was renamed to qt.
   Eg.:
     - TP_QT4_DEPRECATED -> TP_QT_DEPRECATED
     - #include <TelepathyQt4/Foo> -> #include <TelepathyQt/Foo>
 * Errors and constant macros starting with TELEPATHY_ (const char *
   versions) were removed, remaining only the versions that expand to
   QLatin1String.
   Eg.:
     - TELEPATHY_ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE <- removed
     - TP_QT4_ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE -> TP_QT_ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE
 * All deprecated methods (marked with TP_QT4_DEPRECATED) and signals
   (those that used to emit warnings at runtime when connecting to them)
   were removed.
 * StreamTubeChannel::connections() now returns a QSet<uint> instead of an
   UIntList.
 * Channel::groupContacts and groupLocal/RemotePendingContacts() gained
   a "includeSelfContact" param defaulting to true.
 * KeyFile and ManagerFile classes are now removed from public API.
 * SharedPtr cannot be constructed from a QWeakPointer anymore as the
   conversion from a QWeakPointer to a SharedPtr can't be made thread-safe.
   WeakPtr is reintroduced as a weak pointer class safely promoteable to a
   SharedPtr.
 * TelepathyQt-Farsight does not include telepathy-farsight/channel.h
   directly anymore.
 * ContactManager::lookupContactByHandle() is removed from public API.

Enhancements:
 * fd.o #35084: The StreamTubeClient and StreamTubeServer classes have been
   added to allow implementing Telepathy Stream Tube connectivity for
   applications without having to worry about the channel dispatching details
 * Contact::refreshInfo() requests are now batched together on D-Bus
 * fd.o #41356: Implement methods to retrieve available message types on
   TextChannel.
 * fd.o #43631: Add CMake config files. Now CMake projects can find Tp-Qt
   straight away without the need of Find* files.
 * fd.o #43598 - Add high-level API for Proto.I.Addressing interface
 * fd.o #43599 - Add high-level API for Conn.I.Addressing interface

Fixes:
 * Our TODO process being completely out of date. Trying to use doxygen \todo
   annotations from now on
 * FeatureRoster is set on Tp::Connection even for roster-less accounts.

Known issues:
 * Some tests are failing for some Qt 4.7 configurations, reports on fd.o bug
   #43551 please.

telepathy-qt4 0.7.3 (2011-10-07)
================================

The "a must" release.

Enhancements:
 * Added HandleTypeRoom StreamTubes to ChannelClassSpec
 * It is now possible to capture and redirect the library debug output via
   setting a DebugCallback using the Tp::setDebugCallback function
 * The ChannelClassSpec implementation has been optimized, which yields
   ChannelFactory setup and consequently application startup speedups
 * StreamTubeChannel now ensures connectionClosed() is emitted for all
   connections on a closing tube
 * Add Presence/PresenceSpec operator== support
 * Add Presence/PresenceSpec operator!= support (Rohan Garg)
 * Add Authentication.TLSCertificate to the set of generated interfaces
 * Improve file transfer examples to properly use the ChannelDispatcher

Fixes:
 * Ensure that the proper Channel Dispatcher methods are being called when
   creating/ensuring channels.
 * Prevent PendingContacts crashes in corner cases where contacts are still
   being built when a Connection is destroyed. Note that this affects which
   object is returned by PendingContacts::object() - we've now made it explicit
   that object() shouldn't be used externally as we make no guarantees on what
   object it returns, by deprecating it. It will be made protected: in the next
   API break
 * Passing a non-empty service param to
   ChannelClassSpec::{incoming,outgoing}StreamTube() messing up the shared
   instance as used by e.g. ChannelFactory
 * Connections not being removed from StreamTubeChannel::connections() when they
   are closed, and newConnection() and connectionClosed() events getting
   reordered
 * fd.o# 40655 - ChannelDispatchOperation::claim() cannot be used by Approvers
   to handle channels
 * Codegen is now able to utilize types with D-Bus signature aay, aas and aav
 * Account/Connection/Channel now properly check if FeatureCore is ready on
   accessors
 * Readded erroneously removed protected API to StreamTubeChannel, which
   restores full ABI backwards compatibility.

telepathy-qt4 0.7.2 (2011-08-04)
================================

The "Stage 0 Tune Up" release.

Enhancements:
 * Lots of additions and corrections to API documentation
 * Code generator now produces nicer output for member-ref, dbus-ref and
   rationale elements in docstrings
 * The stable D-Bus interfaces Account.Interface.Storage, Channel.Type.DBusTube
   and Channel.Interface.Destroyable have been added to generated bindings

Fixes:
 * Tp::IncomingStreamTubeChannel always reports an empty socket address to
   connect to for accepted Tubes - and various other StreamTube fixes thanks to
   now having unit tests for them

telepathy-qt4 0.7.1 (2011-06-09)
================================

The "where is the file?" release.

Enhancements:
 * fd.o #37034: The URI property can now be set when requesting file transfers,
   and can be read by the Handler (and any Observers) from
   Tp::FileTransferChannel (Daniele E. Domenichelli)
 * Improved tests readability by moving common code into helper classes,
   macros, etc, in preparation for increasing the test coverage

Fixes:
 * Fixed documentation for Contact::publishStateChanged()
   (Daniele E. Domenichelli)
 * Properly crosslink our doxygen docs to Qt documentation on fresh builds
 * Properly generate docs for auto generated classes

telepathy-qt4 0.7.0 (2011-06-01)
================================

The "Doctor Love knew this so he made another great invention just for the
lonely you!" release.

This release begins the new 0.7 development series series for feature additions
following the 0.6 stable release series. Both 0.6 and 0.7 will continue to be
backwards compatible API and ABI wise with the earlier 0.5 development series.

Enhancements:
 * fd.o #35341: Use the new ContactBlocking D-Bus interface for better
   performance in Tp::ContactManager (George Kiagiadakis)
 * ReceivedMessage: Add accessors for retrieving delivery report information,
   sender nickname and superseded message token
 * Crosslink our doxygen docs to Qt documentation

Fixes:
 * Do not close channels created using the request and handle API if MC
   restarts
 * Pass new value correctly as variant in generated binding setProperty* methods
 * Properly initialize Connection account balance members
 * fd.o #36881 - Wrong documentation for Tp::Account::connectionStatusChanged
   (and a bunch of other parts of the API)
 * fd.o #31769 - The documentation of TextChannel's features is not very helpful
 * Skip docs generation for internal OptionalInterfaceCache

telepathy-qt4 0.5.16 (2011-05-01)
=================================

The "A brown paper bagful of Easter Eggs" release.

Enhancements:
 * fd.o #36526: Tp::Channel has now gained targetID() and targetContact()
   accessors
 * fd.o #35421: Update to spec 0.22.0:
  - Added auto generated class for Conn.ContactBlocking
  - Added Connection::ErrorDetails accessors for ConnectionError details
    server-message, user-requested, expected-hostname and certificate-hostname
 * Add support for Conn.SimplePresence.MaximumStatusMessageLength
 * Add Features operator|(Features, Feature)
 * ContactManager state now only advances to Success when both the roster and
   the roster groups have been downloaded, if requested
 * New class SimpleObserver that can be used to observe arbitrary channels on a
   given Account.
 * fd.o #33525 - Helper class(es) for observing calls
   - New class SimpleCallObserver class which makes it easy to follow all
     StreamedMedia communication on a given Account.

Fixes:
 * fd.o #35633: Contact features being erased after further contact upgrades,
   e.g. from ContactFactory used together with Connection::FeatureRosterGroups
 * Contact::groups() and ContactManager::groupContacts() not populated correctly
   when using CMs with new-style ContactGroups D-Bus API
 * Timeout in some CMs when introspecting contact list channels
 * Crashes with Connection::FeatureSelfContact enabled (Manifested as an assert
   for inFlightFeatures or pendingFeatures being hit)
 * Crashes if a connection disconnects while FeatureRosterGroups is being
   introspected (SIGSEGV in PendingOperation from ContactManager::Roster)
 * Added correctly named pretty headers for the
   Conn.ClientTypes/ContactGroups/ContactList/Saving interfaces
 * Odd build system failures from feature checks which were anyway redundant due
   to our recently bumped Qt 4.6+ dependency - checks now removed

telepathy-qt4 0.5.15 (2011-04-12)
=================================

The "How to remove a hole from a set of holes" release.

Enhancements:
 * Performance improvements for introspection (becomeReady() latency)
 * Some documentation improvements.

Fixes:
 * Incorrect scoping for Initial{Audio,Video} properties in Account channel
   request methods
 * Possible deadlock on connection status changes when FeatureConnected is
   requested on a Connection
 * Crash opportunities when introspecting a Connection which disappears in the
   process (e.g. due to a network error or a CM crash)

telepathy-qt4 0.5.14 (2011-04-05)
=================================

The "Now succeeds at failing!" release.

The Qt dependency has been bumped to >= 4.6.0 for all future releases.

Enhancements:
 * AccountManager will now retry introspection 5 times with a 3 seconds interval
   (or immediately if error is Timeout) if the introspection failed and
   becomeReady() will fail if there is still an error after all tries.
 * AccountManager will no more signal newAccount if the initial
   introspection failed.
 * ConnectionCapabilities and ContactCapabilities are now subclassable

Fixes:
 * Regression in 0.5.13 causing PendingReadys to not fail even if the object
   being made ready disappears
 * Discrepancy between the spec and implementation on initially assumed
   non-locally-requested StreamedMediaChannel stream direction
 * Reporting capabilities of offline accounts incorrectly because of a .manager
   file parsing bug

telepathy-qt4 0.5.13 (2011-03-23)
=================================

The "what is my id?" release.

Enhancements:
 * Added example to send messages using ContactMessenger.

Fixes:
 * ContactMessenger: Do not crash if an error occurred normalizing the contact
   identifier but the ContactManager::contactsForIdentifiers() succeeded.
 * Multiple parallel invalidated() signal connections created between DBusProxy
   and ReadinessHelper

telepathy-qt4 0.5.12 (2011-03-18)
=================================

The "Can I use the IM framework for, like, sending and receiving messages" release.

Enhancements:
 * fd.o #28753: Added SimpleTextObserver class which makes it easy to follow all
   text communication on a given Account
 * fd.o #35321: Added ContactMessenger class for easily sending and receiving
   text messages with a particular contact

Fixes:
 * The Request & Handle API spuriously failing with SERVICE_CONFUSED because of
   a race condition with introspecting the proxies

telepathy-qt4 0.5.11 (2011-03-09)
=================================

The "more contacts?" release.

Enhancements:
 * fd.o#33121 - Bind Connection.ContactList.ContactsChangedWithID.

Fixes:
 * ContactManager will now create contact objects even if everything fails but
   we have the contact handle/id and the connection has ImmortalHandles.
 * Ensure FeatureRoster is ready before setting ContactManager state to
   success even in fallback mode.

telepathy-qt4 0.5.10 (2011-03-09)
=================================

The "am I connected?" release.

Enhancements:
 * Added Connection::FeatureConnected to help applications that only care about
   connected connections. Setting this feature on the ConnectionFactory used
   will make sure all connections signalled by the library are connected.

Fixes:
 * Ensure FeatureRoster is ready before setting ContactManager state to
   success.

telepathy-qt4 0.5.9 (2011-03-07)
=================================

The "planned engineering works for the last year" release.

Enhancements:
 * fd.o#28367 - Added High-level API for StreamTube channels
 * fd.o#34228 - Added API on Account for requesting Channels and handling them
   yourself, implemented properly using the Channel Dispatcher service
 * Account::allowedPresenceStatuses() now has fallbacks to include "available"
   and "offline" when that makes sense
 * Removed some more private symbols from the shared library, resulting in
   slightly faster load times
 * Deprecated ConnectionCapabilities contact search related methods with
   singular names and added plural versions of them, for API consistency.
 * Contacts publish/subscription state updates for removed contacts are only
   signalled after the ContactManager::allKnownContactsChanged signal is
   emitted.

Fixes:
 * Redundant Contact::avatarDataChanged() emissions
 * Connection::becomeReady() never finishing in state Connecting, which for
   example prevents handling ServerAuthentication channels. NOTE: any code
   incorrectly relying on the old buggy behavior of becomeReady() only finishing
   once the connection goes Connected or Disconnected may need adjustment.
 * Linking errors referencing the QtXml library
 * Spec-incompliant building of Client names when uniquifying is requested from
   ClientRegistrar
 * Sensitive data in Account parameters being included in debug logs

telepathy-qt4 0.5.8 (2011-02-22)
=================================

The "where are my contacts?" release.

Enhancements:
 * Account won't try to build a Connection object anymore if the connection
   object path hasn't changed.
 * Connection::FeatureRoster will now fail introspection if ContactList
   interface is not supported, neither fallback roster channels.
 * ContactManager now has a state() accessor and a corresponding stateChanged()
   signal to keep track of the progress made in retrieving the contact list.
 * Made Profile/Account/ContactManager debug output a bit cleaner.
 * Cleaned up debug classes by removing unused code.

Fixes:
 * Properly replace "_" with "-" on Account::protocolName().

telepathy-qt4 0.5.7 (2011-02-15)
=================================

The "fit for galoshes" release.

Enhancements:
 * Make the debug subsystem as no-op as possible when debugging is disabled at
   runtime with Tp::enableDebug(false) and Tp::enableWarnings(false).
 * fd.o#33123 - Bind Protocol.Avatars.
 * fd.o#33124 - Bind Protocol.Presence.
 * fd.o#33116 - Added support for passing hints to channel requests, also making
   channel requests marginally more efficient CPU and memory wise in the
   process.
 * fd.o#33117 - Added support for extracting hints from ChannelRequests.
 * fd.o#33117 - Added support for ChannelRequests reporting the channel created
   for them on success, for further observation.

Fixes:
 * fd.o#34131 - Writing avatar cache into $HOME with scratchbox.
 * Unstable generated future-* headers being installed (although nothing
   declared in them was ever exported in the library).
 * Possible crashes in Channel internal updateContacts function when just the
   self handle changed.

telepathy-qt4 0.5.6 (2011-01-27)
=================================

The "accept/decline" release.

Enhancements:
 * Update to spec 0.21.8.
  - Added auto generated classes for Account.Addressing,
    Channel.ServerAuthentication, Channel.SASLAuthentication,
    Channel.Securable and Conn.MainNotification.

Fixes:
 * Properly ignore protocol with invalid names.
 * Properly escape protocol name with "-" when constructing protocol object
   path.
 * Properly link against QtXml.
 * Properly emit presencePublicationRequested if the contact current publish
   state changes to PresenceStateAsk.
 * Added missing fancy-headers for generated classes.

telepathy-qt4 0.5.5 (2011-01-25)
=================================

The "I wish I had less contacts" release.

Enhancements:
 * CapabilitiesBase: Added method to check if file transfer is supported.

Fixes:
 * Contact list contacts are now guaranteed to contain the features set on
   ContactFactory.
 * Contact list groups are now automatically reintrospected when needed.
 * Another attempt to fix a crash when contacts are removed from contact list
   while the introspection is still running.
 * fd.o#33457 - tp-qt4 uses non-atomic file write in avatar cache.

telepathy-qt4 0.5.4 (2011-01-20)
=================================

The "the shower of golden paper bags" release.

Enhancements:
 * Presence publication requests are now reported more sensibly by the
   ContactManager::presencePublicationRequested(Contacts) signal, with the
   per-contact request message, if any, being in Contact::publishStateMessage()

Fixes:
 * ContactManager not emitting presencePublicationRequested if the request
   message is empty.
 * ContactManager sometimes crashing when contacts are removed using the new
   ContactList interface.

telepathy-qt4 0.5.3 (2011-01-17)
=================================

The "contact factorization" release.

Enhancements:
 * Added Tp::Contact::requestAvatarData()
 * Added Tp::Contact::isContactInfoKnown()
 * fd.o#32999 - operator< and qHash are not implemented for
   Tp::ProtocolParameter.
 * fd.o#33119 - Bind Connection.HasImmortalHandles.
 * ContactFactory is no more a stub class. The features set in the
   ContactFactory will be enabled in all contacts created by ContactManager and
   the classes using it (Connection, Channel, etc).

Fixes:
 * Build failures on systems using GNU gold or the
    --no-add-needed/--no-copy-dt-needed-entries linker flags

telepathy-qt4 0.5.2 (2011-01-03)
=================================

The "I'm not subscribed now, right? WRONG" release.

Enhancements:
 * Added Or/NotFilter classes making it more flexible to use the Filter API.
 * Channel invalidation reasons now more accurately describe what happened,
   including a new error TP_QT4_ERROR_ORPHANED for the corresponding Connection
   getting invalidated from whichever reason.
 * Added support for ContactList and ContactGroups interfaces improving
   performance of Connection::FeatureRoster/Groups when the CM supports the new
   interfaces.
 * ContactManager PendingOperations finish at consistent times wrt actual state
   changes when used with a CM sporting the new ContactList/ContactGroups
   interfaces
 * Deprecated Contact/ContactManager signals carrying a
   Channel::GroupMemberChangeDetails param for publish/subscription/block state
   changes and added new signals that should be used in new code.
 * fd.o #31464 - Added Channel::requestLeave() for leaving channels more
   gracefully than closing them; StreamedMediaChannel::hangupCall now uses that

Fixes:
 * Properly install TelepathyQt4/ConnectionManagerLowLevel.
 * A race condition causing proxies to be needlessly dropped from the factory
   cache and hence new proxies built for a future request, and eventually
   hitting an assert in onProxyInvalidated as a result
 * Memory leaks when using Connection::FeatureRoster/RosterGroups where the
   connection and roster channels were leaking.
 * fd.o#29728 - ContactManager::addGroup and removeGroup are confusing/broken.
 * fd.o#29735 - Roster API semantics are error / race condition prone.

telepathy-qt4 0.5.1 (2010-12-08)
=================================

The "lazily evaluated birth" release.

Fixes:
 * fd.o #29731: Memory leaks reported by make check-valgrind
 * Crash using a dangling (const!) iterator when a channel is removed from a
   conference
 * Crash when the an object path for an Account in an account set is quickly
   reused after it's removed
 * Emitting redundant {local,remote}SendingStateChanged signals from
   StreamedMediaChannel
 * ChannelDispatchOperation::channelLost failing to include Tp:: in the signal
   arg type names, making it a tad hard to connect to

telepathy-qt4 0.5.0 (2010-11-16)
=================================

The "new era of breakage" release.

This release IS NOT API/ABI COMPATIBLE WITH EARLIER RELEASES. Further releases
in the 0.5 development series will however be compatible with this release, as
will any releases in a 0.6 stable series.

For enhanced compatibility versions from 0.5 and earlier series can be parallel
installed, with 0.5 bumping the .so major version to .so.1.  However, the
development headers and pkgconfig file can't be parallel installed.

Enhancements:
 * fd.o #28793 - It is no longer necessary to keep the proxy / other object you
   get a PendingOperation from manually referenced until the operation is
   finished
 * fd.o #28797 - generated client code (AbstractInterface subclasses) now allows
   setting a non-default timeout for D-Bus method calls
 * fd.o #29486 - Bare variant maps and string lists are no longer exposed in the
   API unless absolutely necessary; instead they have wrapper classes with
   easy access to well-known keys and values. Among other consequences, this
   means AbstractClient implementations NEED TO CHANGE their method
   implementation signatures to accept the wrapper classes instead of bare
   QVariantMaps.
 * Setting automatic/requested presence in Account now uses Tp::Presence
 * Cleaned up the API and internal code by removing all deprecated classes,
   methods and signals.
 * Added Tp::Object intermediate base class for uniform QObject property change
   notification. Connection, Channel and Contact will be propertified using it
   in the future.
 * Enumeration and flag types generated from the specification can now be used
   in API without endangering ABI stability due to added padding members,
   enhancing type safety in numerous instances where bare uints used to be
   returned / taken as a parameter.
 * Moved low-level functionality which shouldn't be used when using a full
   Telepathy setup with a Mission Control service (Account Manager + Channel
   Dispatcher) available from Connection and ConnectionManager to Lowlevel
   classes, which can be accessed only if TP_QT4_ENABLE_LOWLEVEL_API is #defined
   through a lowlevel() accessor on them
 * Bare pointers are no longer returned from the API, instead either SharedPtr
   or Qt implicitly shared handle classes are used (applicable to
   Connection/ContactCapabilities, ProtocolInfo, etc)
 * Tp::Contact is now a RefCounted and uses Tp::Feature like the rest of the
   library.
 * ClientRegistrar no longer guarantees that a singleton instance is returned
   for create(). In particular, this relaxation allows us to implement an API in
   the future which constructs a ClientRegistrar behind the scenes to be able to
   request and handle channels without manually implementing an
   AbstractClientHandler.
 * The Filter API is now more future-proof, with the assumption that the filter
   chain is ANDed together dropped. It will be possible to combine filters using
   And/Or/Not filter combiners in the future, of which And is included now.
 * The SharedPtr API has been improved. In particular, it's now safe to use it
   as a QMap/QHash key and more difficult to use it incorrectly as a boolean or
   an integer. The redundant WeakPtr class has been removed - use QWeakPointer
   instead (which works with SharedPtr for all QObject classes).
 * Tp::Contact friend list state change signals now have a details argument
   (which will contain e.g. the request message for publishState() == Ask when
    somebody adds you to their contact list, for example). This means that
   code connecting to them NEEDS TO BE CHANGED.
 * Account::haveConnection(Changed) and friends is now the less confusing
   Account::connection(Changed) pair
 * AccountManager filtering methods returning an AccountSet now have more
   descriptive names without the Set suffix
 * Account/Connection/Channel subclasses now can override the "core" feature
   implied by isReady() and becomeReady(). In particular, this means that e.g.
   ContactSearchChannel::isReady() with no arguments will only return true if
   ContactSearchChannel::FeatureCore is ready in addition to
   Channel::FeatureCore.
 * StreamedMediaChannel is once again just for Channel.Type.StreamedMedia
   channels, with the intermediate Call.DRAFT support and API removed. When Call
   is undrafted, a new CallChannel will be added and StreamedMediaChannel
   deprecated.
 * Similarly, hacky Conference.DRAFT support IS REMOVED. Only the final
   Conference interface is supported from now on.
 * Everything that used to be called just Audio/Video/MediaCall etc now has
   StreamedMedia in the name, to not conflict with future Call API.

Fixes:
 * fd.o #27204 - Codegen erroneously uses enums' value-prefix as the name for
   the C++ enum
 * fd.o #29998 - Connecting to signal Tp::TextChannel::chatStateChanged needs
   typedef if not done in Tp namespace
 * fd.o #27795 - Problems using Tp::SharedPtr as a key in QMap
 * ChannelRequest not becoming ready successfully when there is no Account
   specified
 * ContactSearchChannel not initializing its private members correctly
 * Compile errors with QT_STRICT_ITERATORS
 * Some MSVC++ compilation issues (though there still are likely some remaining)
 * ContactManager::allKnownContacts not picking up changes from the "stored"
   list

telepathy-qt4 0.3.14 (2010-11-05)
=================================

The "O HAI MY NAME IS CONFERENCE" release.

Enhancements:
* fd.o #30098 - Added an asynchronous property request API for generated
  low-level proxies
* Added high-level class for SimplePresence and changed Contact to use it,
  deprecating the old methods using SimplePresence directly.
* Added signals deprecation support to Contact.
* Deprecated StreamedMediaChannel methods that only make sense when used with
  Call.DRAFT channels (we're going to drop support for that particular draft in
  0.5.0)
* Deprecated all optional interface convenience methods.
  The methods inherited from OptionalInterfaceFactory should be used directly
  instead if access to low-level proxies is needed.
* Add unnamed (anonymous, TargetHandleType == None) variants for text chats and
  calls to ChannelClassSpec
* Register all non-QObject public classes with the Qt meta-object system, so
  they can e.g. be stored in QVariants.

Fixes:
* Unnamed text and StreamedMedia calls not included in the ChannelFactory
  (channel class) -> (subclass, features) mapping
* Some RequestableChannelClassSpec and ConnectionCapabilities methods having a
  notion of "text chat with a person WHO is a conference", which doesn't exist

telepathy-qt4 0.3.13 (2010-11-01)
=================================

The "sickness won't slow us down" release.

Enhancements:
* Added TP_QT4_ prefixed versions of all generated string constants marked as
  QLatin1String for less verbose usage with Q_NO_CAST_FROM_ASCII
* Added signals deprecation mechanism to warn when a deprecated signal is used.
* fd.o #29451 - Make it possible to specify subclasses to use and features to
  make ready on them in ChannelFactory
* fd.o #29484 - RequestableChannelClass should have high-level API
* fd.o #29486 - Add a ChannelClassSpec class for easily specifying Client
  channel filters (and building Channel requests and ChannelFactory filters for
  advanced usage)
* Added more deprecated methods and remove some methods that should not be
  deprecated. Now the library together with examples builds itself with
  deprecation warnings enabled, to make sure no deprecate method is used
  internally.
* Deprecated autogenerated synchronous properties accessors/setters.

Fixes:
* fd.o #30223 - telepathy-qt4's codegen doesn't deal with tp:external-type
  properly
* fd.o #30923 - Fix compilation errors in 0.3.12
  - The tp-glib version requirement in 0.3.12 was too old
  - Compile error in the tp-glib based test library
* fd.o #31087 - ChannelRequest immutable property extraction relying on
  undefined method argument evaluation order -> failing on some toolchains
* TextChannel never finishing introspection of FeatureMessageQueue with some
  older services
* Properly document ContactSearchChannel signals.
* AccountManager and AccountSet getting confused and hitting asserts with
  certain sequences of introspecting and adding/removing accounts, most
  prominently when removing and readding an account
* Useless PendingReady code having potential for crashes in corner-cases but
  serving no useful purpose (now removed)
* Code generator changes not always triggering rebuilds properly

telepathy-qt4 0.3.12 (2010-10-15)
=================================

The "break is coming" release.

New API:
* Added ContactSearch high-level class.
* Added constructors/accessors for using Channel/ContactFactory in Connection.
* Added high-level class for ContactInfoFieldList.

Enhancements:
* Updated to spec 0.21.1:
  - Added auto generated classes for Conn.ClientTypes/ContactGroups/ContactList/
    PowerSaving and Chan.ServerTLSConnection.
  - Make use of Observer.ObserverInfo.request-properties map, making
    ChannelRequest use the immutable properties defined in the map if
    available, avoiding unneeded introspection.
  - Added support for Conference interface alongside Conference.DRAFT support.
  - Added ConnectionCapabilities methods to check conference support.
* Improved Account::capabilities() to take Profile::unsupportedChannelClasses
  into account.
* Improved StreamedMediaChannel test coverage to yellow (> 80%).

Fixes:
* Properly install TelepathyQt4/Farsight/global.h.
* fd.o#30386 - Regression: StreamedMediaChannel::streamAdded is not emitted when
  one requests a new stream using a StreamedMedia channel type.
* Fixed MediaStream::requestDirection when using a Call channel type.
* Un-deprecate AccountManager methods to retrieve accounts given the account
  paths.
* Some small documentation fixes.

telepathy-qt4 0.3.11 (2010-10-04)
=================================

The "farewell hated friend" release.

Enhancements:
* fd.o #24648 - Port Telepathy-Qt4's build system from autotools to cmake,
  resulting in faster builds. All targets supported by the previous build system
  are still supported, and some new were added, notably individual targets for
  unit tests and callgrind support.
* fd.o #29672 - Support for Profiles - a way to describe different IM/VoIP
  services by data files (e.g. Google Talk for the XMPP/Jabber protocol)
* fd.o #29699 - ChannelRequest immutable data is now accessible even before it's
  fully ready - this is useful for e.g. early initialization of channel context
  in applications with the AbstractClientHandler requestNotification API
* Some performance optimizations in ReadyObject, ReadinessHelper and Channel

Fixes:
 * Race conditions uncovered by Qt 4.7 in TestAccountBasics and TestConnRoster

telepathy-qt4 0.3.10 (2010-09-16)
=================================

The {bool b; if (b == false || b == true || b == 99) { /*...*/ }} release.

Enhancements:
* fd.o #29609 - ClientRegistrar and all related classes now use Factories too,
  which means if you use the factory-enabled create() variants such as
  create(AccountManagerPtr), you can share account and connection proxies with
  the rest of your application, and/or make them be ready by the time your
  addDispatchOperation/handleChannels/observeChannels implementation is called
* fd.o #29090 - Added support to filter accounts by their capabilities (whether
  you can do room chats, voice calls, etc, using a given account)
* Added Account::capabilities(), which automatically gets the capabilities from
  a connected Connection if there's one, or the protocol object if there isn't
* Generic Filter framework, currently only used for Account filtering, but in
  the future also for filtering Contacts
* ChannelRequest is now also using the same Account/Connection etc objects than
  the rest of the application
* PendingChannelRequest now holds a reference to its Account, so you don't have
  to keep a reference to the Account in your application's scope for the channel
  request to succeed
* There are now variants of the ContactManager signals
  presencePublicationRequested, groupMembersChanged and allKnownContactsChanged
  which carry the details parameter (contains things like the message and the
  reason)

Fixes:
* Memory leak when using PendingComposite
* Memory leak in QDBus triggered by ClientHandlerRequestsAdaptor code (there's a
  workaround, and the actual bug is reported as QTBUG-13562)
* The PendingOperation returned by Connection::requestConnect() finishing even
  if the connection wasn't connected yet
* Hitting an assert in cornercases for calling setIntrospectedCalled twice in
  Account Avatar introspection
* Account::changingPresence() not being initialized correctly

telepathy-qt4 0.3.9 (2010-09-10)
================================

The "THE ORIGINAL SWEAT FACTORY^W^WSAUNA MASTER" release.

Enhancements:
* fd.o #29451 - Add Factory infrastructure, enabling:
   - sharing accounts/connections between different parts of the library better
     (this will soon enable us to eliminate duplicate objects between
     AbstractClient implementations and the AM)
   - requesting that all accounts/connections/channels/contacts are always ready
     with given features
   - automatically constructing application-defined subclasses whenever eg. an
     Account is constructed
* Add finished and usable AccountFactory and ConnectionFactory APIs, and also
  added API/ABI placeholder ChannelFactory and ContactFactory APIs which will be
  more useful soon
* fd.o #29606 - Use factories in AccountManager and Account for constructing
  Accounts and Connections -> if desired features are enabled, one no longer
  needs to make any Account::becomeReady and Connection::becomeReady calls when
  using an AccountManager
* fd.o #29409 - Use QDBusServiceWatcher if available, reducing wakeups
* fd.o #20034 - Add avatar cache implementation and featureAvatarData on
  Tp::Contact using it.
* Made Channel::groupSelfContact() always have some contact for the user as long
  as the channel is ready (if the group has none, the Connection one is used)
* (Side-effect from other work) Add fallbacks to channel requests in case the
  service doesn't provide the InitiatorHandle or the Requested property
* Made Channel debug output a bit cleaner
* Added Connection::ErrorDetails to represent additional information about error
  conditions causing Connection invalidation
* Made the Connection API guide the applications better to correct error
  handling practices (all error handling should be done in invalidated() slots)
* Add SharedPtr::qobjectCast(), an upcasting constructor and pointer to const
  support

Fixes:
* A race condition which could result in Channel ignoring a member change (only
  applicable to services with Group.MembersChangedDetailed)
* A bug where Channel::groupMembersChanged(only removed members) isn't always
  emitted if the local user is not a member of the group - probably means
  signaling contacts being removed from roster groups didn't work either
* Yet another TestConnRosterGroup race condition (freq: 6 in 20000 runs)
* fd.o#29930 - Build error with glib 2.25
* ReadyObjects incorrectly handling feature dependencies
* Account/Connection/Channel readifying themselves even if not asked to
* Handle reference management screwing up if there are multiple connections
  online on a single CM
* Lots of crash opportunities when a PendingOperation is underway when its
  parent-ish object is unreferenced in an application

* Added the script repeat-tests.sh for repeating tests to detect race conditions
* Added a conservative 10 minute per test watchdog to detect hung-up test logic
  - Should be plenty even for heavily loaded VM build bots, as the whole test
    suite now executes in 2.4-2.5 seconds on my laptop
* The StreamedMedia legacy and Future.Call tests now actually have different
  names to be able to distinguish between them in the test logs
* Test coverage reporting now works again; turns out we need to disable building
  the shared library when it is enabled
* amd64 memory use errors (pointer size != int size) calling g_object_new() in
  tests have been fixed

telepathy-qt4 0.3.7 (2010-07-12)

telepathy-qt4 0.2.1 (2009-12-04)
================================

The "all you want, only better" release.

Fixes:

* fd.o #25058: reduce the scope of our workaround for Qt 4.5 bug
  <http://qt.gitorious.org/qt/qt/merge_requests/1657>, fixing compilation
  against Qt versions >= 4.6 beta, where this bug has been fixed (smcv)

* Avoid the installed AccountManager (if any) being service-activated during
  distcheck under some circumstances (smcv)

* Compile with symbols hidden by default, explicitly export a few
  symbols that were mistakenly not exported, and improve the code generation
  tools to be more correct about their exports (smcv)

* Improve the code-generation tools to cope with UTF-8 in the spec (wjt, smcv)

* Enable Automake 1.11 silent building (./configure --enable-silent-rules
  to enable this) (wjt)

Code generation release notes:

* qt4-types-gen.py and qt4-client-gen.py previously forced the generated
  classes to be exported, in a way that's not actually correct for code outside
  telepathy-qt4 (the TELEPATHY_QT4_EXPORT macro).
  
  They now use a macro set by --visibility, defaulting to nothing; if you're
  building a shared library with -fvisibility=hidden, or supporting Windows,
  you may need to use --visibility=YOUR_LIB_EXPORT when running these scripts.

  See TelepathyQt4/global.h or QtDBus/qdbusmacros.h for an example of setting
  up such a macro (unfortunately, the only correct way to do this seems to be
  for each shared library to define its own).

* Renamed SharedData header file to RefCounted to follow class name.

New API:

* Update to telepathy-spec 0.17.24, breaking some D-Bus APIs:
  * fd.o #21619: Account::updateParameters() returns a PendingStringList of
    the parameters that won't be changed until reconnection takes place
  * Account::reconnect() added (newer MC versions don't violate telepathy-spec
    by reconnecting automatically when parameters are changed)
  * AccountManager::supportedAccountProperties() added
  * AccountManager::createAccount() takes an optional dict of properties
    (the valid keys are in supportedAccountProperties())

* Enhance PendingStringList to have a constructor from a QDBusPendingCall

Bugfixes:

* Don't try to run Python tests unless we have the gobject module (the tests
  use it)

telepathy-qt4 0.1.3 (2009-04-22)
================================

The "what are you scared of?" release.

Dependencies:

* Full regression tests now require telepathy-glib >= 0.7.28 (telepathy-glib
  is still optional)

API changes:

* Namespace simplification: Telepathy::Client::Channel (etc.) are now
  Tp::Channel, similar to telepathy-glib's TpChannel. Auto-generated client
  classes like Telepathy::Client::ChannelInterface are now
  Tp::Client::ChannelInterface.

* AccountManager, Account, ConnectionManager, Connection, Channel and Channel
  subclasses now inherit from Tp::RefCounted and are used together with
  Tp::SharedPtr/Tp::WeakPtr, shared and weak pointer classes using ideas from
  Qt, glibmm, Boost and WebKit. The constructor is now protected (in order to
  support custom classes) and a public create method that returns a SharedPtr
  was added. This is an attempt to avoid memory leaks as much as possible, see
  http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/telepathy/2009-March/003218.html for
  more details.

* Instead of forward-declaring Telepathy::Client::Channel and using
  a variable of type Telepathy::Client::Channel *, you should now include
  <TelepathyQt4/Types> and use either Tp::ChannelPtr, which is a
  reference-counted shared pointer, or Tp::WeakPtr<Tp::Channel>, which is the
  weak counterpart.
* Header simplification: the public headers now look like
  <TelepathyQt4/Channel>, i.e. without the Client subdirectory.

* PendingHandles now finish successfully on non fatal errors (InvalidArgument,
  InvalidHandle, NotAvailable). PendingHandles::invalidNames/invalidHandles
  should be used to check if a non-fatal error occurred and some handle could
  not be acquired.

Enhancements:

* Updated to telepathy-spec 0.17.23

* TelepathyQt4Farsight is a new mini-library with glue code to connect
  telepathy-farsight to Telepathy-Qt4. Handlers for streamed media channels
  with media signalling can #include <TelepathyQt4/Farsight/Channel> and pass
  their Tp::StreamedMediaChannel to Tp::createFarsightChannel, then hook up
  the resulting TfChannel to a GStreamer pipeline of their choice.

* StreamedMediaChannel has a new handlerStreamingRequired method so you can
  check whether the handler needs to carry out the streaming

* fd.o #21336: Channels now indicate whether a message is expected when
  doing various Group operations

* fd.o #21337: Account supports the new HasBeenOnline property

Fixes:

* fd.o #20583: Contact objects don't work without the Contacts interface.

* fd.o #20584: Contact object creation doesn't survive bad IDs or handles.

telepathy-qt4 0.1.2 (2009-03-23)
================================

The "robotic automatic hoover" release.

Dependencies:

* Full regression tests now require telepathy-glib >= 0.7.27 (telepathy-glib
  is still optional)

* telepathy-farsight >= 0.0.4 is a new optional dependency

API changes:

* AccountManager, Account, ConnectionManager, Connection, Channel
  now inherit QSharedData and are used together with
  QExplicitlySharedDataPointer.
  This is needed so we can create shared pointers based on the object itself,
  instead of doing hacks to find the shared pointer related to a given object.
  See http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/telepathy/2009-March/003168.html for
  more details.

* Channel Features are now Feature objects, not integers

* The Feature class is now in its own header, <TelepathyQt4/Feature>

Enhancements:

* The skeletal StreamedMediaChannel class from 0.1.0 has been expanded to
  cover all the functionality of the Telepathy StreamedMedia interface

* PendingConnection, PendingAccount etc. have busName and objectPath
  methods where necessary, so that objects of custom classes can be
  constructed

* Features can now be considered critical, meaning that failure to set them up
  leads to failure of becomeReady() - this should only be used for features
  that should never fail unless the service is buggy, like Connection and
  Channel core functionality

* examples/call/ is an example of how to use StreamedMediaChannel, which can
  make and receive XMPP Jingle calls using telepathy-gabble
  (this feature requires telepathy-farsight and GStreamer)

Fixes:

* When introspection of a Feature fails, the D-Bus error is propagated as the
  failure reason of becomeReady()

* Fix a memory leak in TextChannel

telepathy-qt4 0.1.1 (2009-03-05)
================================

The "PresencePublicationAuthorizationRequestRejection" release.

API changes:

* PendingReadyAccount, PendingReadyAccountManager, PendingReadyConnection,
  PendingReadyConnectionManager have all been replaced by the PendingReady
  class

* Account, AccountManager, Connection and ConnectionManager features are now
  QSet<uint>, not bitfields

* Plural contacts are generally represented by a QSet<QSharedPointer<Contact> >
  instead of a QList<QSharedPointer<Contact> > (with a new typedef,
  Telepathy::Client::Contacts, which must be used in signal/slot connections)

Enhancements:

* Added Connection::FeatureRoster, which, when enabled, adds contact list
  (a.k.a. roster/buddy list) functionality to the ContactManager and
  Contact objects

* Improved maintainability of Account, AccountManager, Connection and
  ConnectionManager becoming ready

* A QSharedPointer<Contact> is now hashable with qHash, meaning contacts can
  be QSet or QHash members

* Added a trivial contact list user interface, examples/roster/roster

Fixes:

* The client library no longer attempts to enforce group add/remove flags:
  whatever change the user requests is passed on to the connection manager
  (which might reject it)

* PendingReady objects returned by Connection::becomeReady() have the
  Connection as parent, rather than an internal object that isn't useful
  to library users

telepathy-qt4 0.1.0 (2009-02-26)
================================

The "pending operation" release.

This first release of telepathy-qt4 features high-level API for the following:

* Manipulating accounts on a Telepathy AccountManager implementation as
  described by telepathy-spec 0.17.x, such as Mission Control 5 (beta versions
  currently available)

* Manipulating Telepathy connection managers via the ConnectionManager and
  Connection core API

* Setting your own presence on a connection manager supporting the
  SimplePresence interface

* Requesting channels from a connection manager supporting the Requests
  interface

* Reading contacts' aliases etc. on a connection manager supporting the
  Contacts interface

* Sending and receiving messages on Text channels, with or without the
  Messages interface

In addition, lower-level auto-generated accessors are provided for all the
functionality of telepathy-spec version 0.17.19.

Notable functionality that is currently missing, but will be added soon,
includes:

* Manipulating a server-stored contact list

* Controlling VoIP calls in StreamedMedia channels

/* ex: set textwidth=80: */
