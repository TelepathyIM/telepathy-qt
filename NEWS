telepathy-qt4 0.5.2 (UNRELEASED)
=================================

The "..." release.

Enhancements:
 * ...

Fixes:

telepathy-qt4 0.5.1 (2010-12-08)
=================================

The "lazily evaluated birth" release.

Fixes:
 * fd.o #29731: Memory leaks reported by make check-valgrind
 * Crash using a dangling (const!) iterator when a channel is removed from a
   conference
 * Crash when the an object path for an Account in an account set is quickly
   reused after it's removed
 * Emitting redundant {local,remote}SendingStateChanged signals from
   StreamedMediaChannel
 * ChannelDispatchOperation::channelLost failing to include Tp:: in the signal
   arg type names, making it a tad hard to connect to

telepathy-qt4 0.5.0 (2010-11-16)
=================================

The "new era of breakage" release.

This release IS NOT API/ABI COMPATIBLE WITH EARLIER RELEASES. Further releases
in the 0.5 development series will however be compatible with this release, as
will any releases in a 0.6 stable series.

For enhanced compatibility versions from 0.5 and earlier series can be parallel
installed, with 0.5 bumping the .so major version to .so.1.  However, the
development headers and pkgconfig file can't be parallel installed.

Enhancements:
 * fd.o #28793 - It is no longer necessary to keep the proxy / other object you
   get a PendingOperation from manually referenced until the operation is
   finished
 * fd.o #28797 - generated client code (AbstractInterface subclasses) now allows
   setting a non-default timeout for D-Bus method calls
 * fd.o #29486 - Bare variant maps and string lists are no longer exposed in the
   API unless absolutely necessary; instead they have wrapper classes with
   easy access to well-known keys and values. Among other consequences, this
   means AbstractClient implementations NEED TO CHANGE their method
   implementation signatures to accept the wrapper classes instead of bare
   QVariantMaps.
 * Setting automatic/requested presence in Account now uses Tp::Presence
 * Cleaned up the API and internal code by removing all deprecated classes,
   methods and signals.
 * Added Tp::Object intermediate base class for uniform QObject property change
   notification. Connection, Channel and Contact will be propertified using it
   in the future.
 * Enumeration and flag types generated from the specification can now be used
   in API without endangering ABI stability due to added padding members,
   enhancing type safety in numerous instances where bare uints used to be
   returned / taken as a parameter.
 * Moved low-level functionality which shouldn't be used when using a full
   Telepathy setup with a Mission Control service (Account Manager + Channel
   Dispatcher) available from Connection and ConnectionManager to Lowlevel
   classes, which can be accessed only if TP_QT4_ENABLE_LOWLEVEL_API is #defined
   through a lowlevel() accessor on them
 * Bare pointers are no longer returned from the API, instead either SharedPtr
   or Qt implicitly shared handle classes are used (applicable to
   Connection/ContactCapabilities, ProtocolInfo, etc)
 * Tp::Contact is now a RefCounted and uses Tp::Feature like the rest of the
   library.
 * ClientRegistrar no longer guarantees that a singleton instance is returned
   for create(). In particular, this relaxation allows us to implement an API in
   the future which constructs a ClientRegistrar behind the scenes to be able to
   request and handle channels without manually implementing an
   AbstractClientHandler.
 * The Filter API is now more future-proof, with the assumption that the filter
   chain is ANDed together dropped. It will be possible to combine filters using
   And/Or/Not filter combiners in the future, of which And is included now.
 * The SharedPtr API has been improved. In particular, it's now safe to use it
   as a QMap/QHash key and more difficult to use it incorrectly as a boolean or
   an integer. The redundant WeakPtr class has been removed - use QWeakPointer
   instead (which works with SharedPtr for all QObject classes).
 * Tp::Contact friend list state change signals now have a details argument
   (which will contain e.g. the request message for publishState() == Ask when
    somebody adds you to their contact list, for example). This means that
   code connecting to them NEEDS TO BE CHANGED.
 * Account::haveConnection(Changed) and friends is now the less confusing
   Account::connection(Changed) pair
 * AccountManager filtering methods returning an AccountSet now have more
   descriptive names without the Set suffix
 * Account/Connection/Channel subclasses now can override the "core" feature
   implied by isReady() and becomeReady(). In particular, this means that e.g.
   ContactSearchChannel::isReady() with no arguments will only return true if
   ContactSearchChannel::FeatureCore is ready in addition to
   Channel::FeatureCore.
 * StreamedMediaChannel is once again just for Channel.Type.StreamedMedia
   channels, with the intermediate Call.DRAFT support and API removed. When Call
   is undrafted, a new CallChannel will be added and StreamedMediaChannel
   deprecated.
 * Similarly, hacky Conference.DRAFT support IS REMOVED. Only the final
   Conference interface is supported from now on.
 * Everything that used to be called just Audio/Video/MediaCall etc now has
   StreamedMedia in the name, to not conflict with future Call API.

Fixes:
 * fd.o #27204 - Codegen erroneously uses enums' value-prefix as the name for
   the C++ enum
 * fd.o #29998 - Connecting to signal Tp::TextChannel::chatStateChanged needs
   typedef if not done in Tp namespace
 * fd.o #27795 - Problems using Tp::SharedPtr as a key in QMap
 * ChannelRequest not becoming ready successfully when there is no Account
   specified
 * ContactSearchChannel not initializing its private members correctly
 * Compile errors with QT_STRICT_ITERATORS
 * Some MSVC++ compilation issues (though there still are likely some remaining)
 * ContactManager::allKnownContacts not picking up changes from the "stored"
   list

telepathy-qt4 0.3.14 (2010-11-05)
=================================

The "O HAI MY NAME IS CONFERENCE" release.

Enhancements:
* fd.o #30098 - Added an asynchronous property request API for generated
  low-level proxies
* Added high-level class for SimplePresence and changed Contact to use it,
  deprecating the old methods using SimplePresence directly.
* Added signals deprecation support to Contact.
* Deprecated StreamedMediaChannel methods that only make sense when used with
  Call.DRAFT channels (we're going to drop support for that particular draft in
  0.5.0)
* Deprecated all optional interface convenience methods.
  The methods inherited from OptionalInterfaceFactory should be used directly
  instead if access to low-level proxies is needed.
* Add unnamed (anonymous, TargetHandleType == None) variants for text chats and
  calls to ChannelClassSpec
* Register all non-QObject public classes with the Qt meta-object system, so
  they can e.g. be stored in QVariants.

Fixes:
* Unnamed text and StreamedMedia calls not included in the ChannelFactory
  (channel class) -> (subclass, features) mapping
* Some RequestableChannelClassSpec and ConnectionCapabilities methods having a
  notion of "text chat with a person WHO is a conference", which doesn't exist

telepathy-qt4 0.3.13 (2010-11-01)
=================================

The "sickness won't slow us down" release.

Enhancements:
* Added TP_QT4_ prefixed versions of all generated string constants marked as
  QLatin1String for less verbose usage with Q_NO_CAST_FROM_ASCII
* Added signals deprecation mechanism to warn when a deprecated signal is used.
* fd.o #29451 - Make it possible to specify subclasses to use and features to
  make ready on them in ChannelFactory
* fd.o #29484 - RequestableChannelClass should have high-level API
* fd.o #29486 - Add a ChannelClassSpec class for easily specifying Client
  channel filters (and building Channel requests and ChannelFactory filters for
  advanced usage)
* Added more deprecated methods and remove some methods that should not be
  deprecated. Now the library together with examples builds itself with
  deprecation warnings enabled, to make sure no deprecate method is used
  internally.
* Deprecated autogenerated synchronous properties accessors/setters.

Fixes:
* fd.o #30223 - telepathy-qt4's codegen doesn't deal with tp:external-type
  properly
* fd.o #30923 - Fix compilation errors in 0.3.12
  - The tp-glib version requirement in 0.3.12 was too old
  - Compile error in the tp-glib based test library
* fd.o #31087 - ChannelRequest immutable property extraction relying on
  undefined method argument evaluation order -> failing on some toolchains
* TextChannel never finishing introspection of FeatureMessageQueue with some
  older services
* Properly document ContactSearchChannel signals.
* AccountManager and AccountSet getting confused and hitting asserts with
  certain sequences of introspecting and adding/removing accounts, most
  prominently when removing and readding an account
* Useless PendingReady code having potential for crashes in corner-cases but
  serving no useful purpose (now removed)
* Code generator changes not always triggering rebuilds properly

telepathy-qt4 0.3.12 (2010-10-15)
=================================

The "break is coming" release.

New API:
* Added ContactSearch high-level class.
* Added constructors/accessors for using Channel/ContactFactory in Connection.
* Added high-level class for ContactInfoFieldList.

Enhancements:
* Updated to spec 0.21.1:
  - Added auto generated classes for Conn.ClientTypes/ContactGroups/ContactList/
    PowerSaving and Chan.ServerTLSConnection.
  - Make use of Observer.ObserverInfo.request-properties map, making
    ChannelRequest use the immutable properties defined in the map if
    available, avoiding unneeded introspection.
  - Added support for Conference interface alongside Conference.DRAFT support.
  - Added ConnectionCapabilities methods to check conference support.
* Improved Account::capabilities() to take Profile::unsupportedChannelClasses
  into account.
* Improved StreamedMediaChannel test coverage to yellow (> 80%).

Fixes:
* Properly install TelepathyQt4/Farsight/global.h.
* fd.o#30386 - Regression: StreamedMediaChannel::streamAdded is not emitted when
  one requests a new stream using a StreamedMedia channel type.
* Fixed MediaStream::requestDirection when using a Call channel type.
* Un-deprecate AccountManager methods to retrieve accounts given the account
  paths.
* Some small documentation fixes.

telepathy-qt4 0.3.11 (2010-10-04)
=================================

The "farewell hated friend" release.

Enhancements:
* fd.o #24648 - Port Telepathy-Qt4's build system from autotools to cmake,
  resulting in faster builds. All targets supported by the previous build system
  are still supported, and some new were added, notably individual targets for
  unit tests and callgrind support.
* fd.o #29672 - Support for Profiles - a way to describe different IM/VoIP
  services by data files (e.g. Google Talk for the XMPP/Jabber protocol)
* fd.o #29699 - ChannelRequest immutable data is now accessible even before it's
  fully ready - this is useful for e.g. early initialization of channel context
  in applications with the AbstractClientHandler requestNotification API
* Some performance optimizations in ReadyObject, ReadinessHelper and Channel

Fixes:
 * Race conditions uncovered by Qt 4.7 in TestAccountBasics and TestConnRoster

telepathy-qt4 0.3.10 (2010-09-16)
=================================

The {bool b; if (b == false || b == true || b == 99) { /*...*/ }} release.

Enhancements:
* fd.o #29609 - ClientRegistrar and all related classes now use Factories too,
  which means if you use the factory-enabled create() variants such as
  create(AccountManagerPtr), you can share account and connection proxies with
  the rest of your application, and/or make them be ready by the time your
  addDispatchOperation/handleChannels/observeChannels implementation is called
* fd.o #29090 - Added support to filter accounts by their capabilities (whether
  you can do room chats, voice calls, etc, using a given account)
* Added Account::capabilities(), which automatically gets the capabilities from
  a connected Connection if there's one, or the protocol object if there isn't
* Generic Filter framework, currently only used for Account filtering, but in
  the future also for filtering Contacts
* ChannelRequest is now also using the same Account/Connection etc objects than
  the rest of the application
* PendingChannelRequest now holds a reference to its Account, so you don't have
  to keep a reference to the Account in your application's scope for the channel
  request to succeed
* There are now variants of the ContactManager signals
  presencePublicationRequested, groupMembersChanged and allKnownContactsChanged
  which carry the details parameter (contains things like the message and the
  reason)

Fixes:
* Memory leak when using PendingComposite
* Memory leak in QDBus triggered by ClientHandlerRequestsAdaptor code (there's a
  workaround, and the actual bug is reported as QTBUG-13562)
* The PendingOperation returned by Connection::requestConnect() finishing even
  if the connection wasn't connected yet
* Hitting an assert in cornercases for calling setIntrospectedCalled twice in
  Account Avatar introspection
* Account::changingPresence() not being initialized correctly

telepathy-qt4 0.3.9 (2010-09-10)
================================

The "THE ORIGINAL SWEAT FACTORY^W^WSAUNA MASTER" release.

Enhancements:
* fd.o #29451 - Add Factory infrastructure, enabling:
   - sharing accounts/connections between different parts of the library better
     (this will soon enable us to eliminate duplicate objects between
     AbstractClient implementations and the AM)
   - requesting that all accounts/connections/channels/contacts are always ready
     with given features
   - automatically constructing application-defined subclasses whenever eg. an
     Account is constructed
* Add finished and usable AccountFactory and ConnectionFactory APIs, and also
  added API/ABI placeholder ChannelFactory and ContactFactory APIs which will be
  more useful soon
* fd.o #29606 - Use factories in AccountManager and Account for constructing
  Accounts and Connections -> if desired features are enabled, one no longer
  needs to make any Account::becomeReady and Connection::becomeReady calls when
  using an AccountManager
* fd.o #29409 - Use QDBusServiceWatcher if available, reducing wakeups
* fd.o #20034 - Add avatar cache implementation and featureAvatarData on
  Tp::Contact using it.
* Made Channel::groupSelfContact() always have some contact for the user as long
  as the channel is ready (if the group has none, the Connection one is used)
* (Side-effect from other work) Add fallbacks to channel requests in case the
  service doesn't provide the InitiatorHandle or the Requested property
* Made Channel debug output a bit cleaner
* Added Connection::ErrorDetails to represent additional information about error
  conditions causing Connection invalidation
* Made the Connection API guide the applications better to correct error
  handling practices (all error handling should be done in invalidated() slots)
* Add SharedPtr::qobjectCast(), an upcasting constructor and pointer to const
  support

Fixes:
* A race condition which could result in Channel ignoring a member change (only
  applicable to services with Group.MembersChangedDetailed)
* A bug where Channel::groupMembersChanged(only removed members) isn't always
  emitted if the local user is not a member of the group - probably means
  signaling contacts being removed from roster groups didn't work either
* Yet another TestConnRosterGroup race condition (freq: 6 in 20000 runs)
* fd.o#29930 - Build error with glib 2.25
* ReadyObjects incorrectly handling feature dependencies
* Account/Connection/Channel readifying themselves even if not asked to
* Handle reference management screwing up if there are multiple connections
  online on a single CM
* Lots of crash opportunities when a PendingOperation is underway when its
  parent-ish object is unreferenced in an application

telepathy-qt4 0.3.8 (2010-08-24)

                - Recent CMs are now introspected with less D-Bus calls
                - New API capabilities(), vcardField(), englishName(),
                  iconName() on ProtocolInfo and ManagerFile
* fd.o#25126 - Some redundant debug output has been removed
* fd.o#27460 - Connection now introspects recent CMs with less D-Bus traffic
* Connection::contactManager and ::capabilities are now less of a death-trap
  - now always are non-NULL
  - operations fail with descriptive errors if the Connection isn't valid
  - they used to go NULL at an indeterminate time when eg. disconnecting
* Account::connection() object path parsing has been optimized

Fixes:
* fd.o#28947 - Account::filterAccounts doc does not properly format the example
  code
* fd.o#28651 - Cannot receive files using gabble 0.9
* fd.o#29145 - AccountSet::accountRemoved is emitted for newly-created
  non-matching accounts
* fd.o#29699 - ChannelRequest incorrectly checks immutable properties

Test suite improvements:
* fd.o#29702 - Unit tests now execute reliably, and 10-30x faster
* Added the script repeat-tests.sh for repeating tests to detect race conditions
* Added a conservative 10 minute per test watchdog to detect hung-up test logic
  - Should be plenty even for heavily loaded VM build bots, as the whole test
    suite now executes in 2.4-2.5 seconds on my laptop
* The StreamedMedia legacy and Future.Call tests now actually have different
  names to be able to distinguish between them in the test logs
* Test coverage reporting now works again; turns out we need to disable building
  the shared library when it is enabled
* amd64 memory use errors (pointer size != int size) calling g_object_new() in
  tests have been fixed

telepathy-qt4 0.3.7 (2010-07-12)

  style fixes.

Fixes:

  was never finishing.

telepathy-qt4 0.3.0 (2010-03-18)
================================

The "With My Own Two Hands" release.

Dependencies:

* Full regression tests now require telepathy-glib >= 0.10.0 (telepathy-glib
  is still optional)

================================

The "no pain, no gain" release.

New API:

* AbstractClientHandler: Added support to set Handler Capabilities property.

Fixes:

* fd.o #25659: ObserveChannels implementation might actually return immediately.

telepathy-qt4 0.2.1 (2009-12-04)
================================

The "all you want, only better" release.

Fixes:

* fd.o #25058: reduce the scope of our workaround for Qt 4.5 bug
  <http://qt.gitorious.org/qt/qt/merge_requests/1657>, fixing compilation
  against Qt versions >= 4.6 beta, where this bug has been fixed (smcv)

* Avoid the installed AccountManager (if any) being service-activated during
  distcheck under some circumstances (smcv)

* Compile with symbols hidden by default, explicitly export a few
  symbols that were mistakenly not exported, and improve the code generation
  tools to be more correct about their exports (smcv)

* Improve the code-generation tools to cope with UTF-8 in the spec (wjt, smcv)

* Enable Automake 1.11 silent building (./configure --enable-silent-rules
  to enable this) (wjt)

Code generation release notes:

* qt4-types-gen.py and qt4-client-gen.py previously forced the generated
  classes to be exported, in a way that's not actually correct for code outside
  telepathy-qt4 (the TELEPATHY_QT4_EXPORT macro).
  
  They now use a macro set by --visibility, defaulting to nothing; if you're
  building a shared library with -fvisibility=hidden, or supporting Windows,
  you may need to use --visibility=YOUR_LIB_EXPORT when running these scripts.

  See TelepathyQt4/global.h or QtDBus/qdbusmacros.h for an example of setting
  up such a macro (unfortunately, the only correct way to do this seems to be
  for each shared library to define its own).

telepathy-qt4 0.2.0 (2009-11-10)

================================

The "an enzyme that breaks down tigers" release.

New API:

* TextChannel: Added ChatState interface support.

  support delivery reports.

Fixes:

* pkgconfig: Added missing QtNetwork dependency.

telepathy-qt4 0.1.11 (2009-10-08)
================================

The "on more to go" release.

* Removed cli/Client from header guards.

Fixes:

* fd.o #20269: Channel's Contact objects should initially have no features.
* fd.o #21335: Implement Group self-handle removal reasons.
* fd.o #23040: Running connection managers appear twice in
  ConnectionManager::listNames result.

telepathy-qt4 0.1.8 (2009-06-16)
================================

The "Every Good Boy Deserves Frontalot" release.

New API:

* Added PendingChannelRequest class to be used when requesting channels using
  ChannelDispatcher through Account.
* Added Account methods to request/create channels using ChannelDispatcher
  (ensureTextChat, ensureTextChatroom, ensureMediaCall, createChannel and
  ensureChannel)

Enhancements:

* Updated to telepathy-spec 0.17.26

Fixes:

* ChannelDispatchOperation: Read Channels property instead of incorrectly
  reading ChannelDetailsList (Patch from George Kiagiadakis
  <kiagiadakis.george@gmail.com>).

telepathy-qt4 0.1.7 (2009-06-02)
================================

The "approver" release.

New API:

* Added Client Approver support.
* Added ChannelDispatchOperation high-level class.

Bugfixes:

* Fixed bug 21988: Channel does not work properly if the parent
  connection object is not ready
* Fixed bug 21993: TextChannel does not become ready until first message is
  received if FeatureMessageQueue is enabled.

telepathy-qt4 0.1.6 (2009-05-28)
================================

The "So hot, I have a fever" release.

New API:

* Added Channel::immutableProperties public method.

Enhancements:

* Added ChannelFactory, internal class to create channels based on
  their types.
* PendingChannel: Use ChannelFactory to create channels.

Bugfixes:

* Proper define AbstractClientPtr.
* ClientRegistrar: Fixed Observer adaptor introspection data.
* ClientRegistrar: Use ChannelFactory to create Channels.

telepathy-qt4 0.1.5 (2009-05-19)
================================

The "do not look at the conductor" release.

New API:

* Added Client support (Handler, Observer).
  * Added ClientRegistrar, class responsible for registering clients and proper
    exporting their D-Bus interfaces.
  * Added AbstractClientObserver, AbstractClientApprover (skeleton) and
    AbstractClientHandler. Clients should inherit one or some combination of
    these, by using multiple inheritance, and register themselves using
    ClientRegistrar::registerClient() in order to become a Client.

* Added ChannelRequest high-level class.

telepathy-qt4 0.1.4 (2009-05-08)
================================

The "global military-industrial complex is subsidising your iPod" release.

Dependencies:

* Creating accounts, and possibly updating their parameters, now requires an
  AccountManager implementing telepathy-spec 0.17.24, such as
  telepathy-mission-control >= 5.0.beta70 (in particular, beta 69 won't work,
  and the KWallet-based account manager will also need updating)

API changes:

* Renamed SharedData header file to RefCounted to follow class name.

New API:

* Update to telepathy-spec 0.17.24, breaking some D-Bus APIs:
  * fd.o #21619: Account::updateParameters() returns a PendingStringList of
    the parameters that won't be changed until reconnection takes place
  * Account::reconnect() added (newer MC versions don't violate telepathy-spec
    by reconnecting automatically when parameters are changed)
  * AccountManager::supportedAccountProperties() added
  * AccountManager::createAccount() takes an optional dict of properties
    (the valid keys are in supportedAccountProperties())

* Enhance PendingStringList to have a constructor from a QDBusPendingCall

Bugfixes:

* Don't try to run Python tests unless we have the gobject module (the tests
  use it)

telepathy-qt4 0.1.3 (2009-04-22)
================================

The "what are you scared of?" release.

Dependencies:

* Full regression tests now require telepathy-glib >= 0.7.28 (telepathy-glib
  is still optional)

API changes:

* Namespace simplification: Telepathy::Client::Channel (etc.) are now
  Tp::Channel, similar to telepathy-glib's TpChannel. Auto-generated client
  classes like Telepathy::Client::ChannelInterface are now
  Tp::Client::ChannelInterface.

* AccountManager, Account, ConnectionManager, Connection, Channel and Channel
  subclasses now inherit from Tp::RefCounted and are used together with
  Tp::SharedPtr/Tp::WeakPtr, shared and weak pointer classes using ideas from
  Qt, glibmm, Boost and WebKit. The constructor is now protected (in order to
  support custom classes) and a public create method that returns a SharedPtr
  was added. This is an attempt to avoid memory leaks as much as possible, see
  http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/telepathy/2009-March/003218.html for
  more details.

* Instead of forward-declaring Telepathy::Client::Channel and using
  a variable of type Telepathy::Client::Channel *, you should now include
  <TelepathyQt4/Types> and use either Tp::ChannelPtr, which is a
  reference-counted shared pointer, or Tp::WeakPtr<Tp::Channel>, which is the
  weak counterpart.
* Header simplification: the public headers now look like
  <TelepathyQt4/Channel>, i.e. without the Client subdirectory.

* PendingHandles now finish successfully on non fatal errors (InvalidArgument,
  InvalidHandle, NotAvailable). PendingHandles::invalidNames/invalidHandles
  should be used to check if a non-fatal error occurred and some handle could
  not be acquired.

Enhancements:

* Updated to telepathy-spec 0.17.23

* TelepathyQt4Farsight is a new mini-library with glue code to connect
  telepathy-farsight to Telepathy-Qt4. Handlers for streamed media channels
  with media signalling can #include <TelepathyQt4/Farsight/Channel> and pass
  their Tp::StreamedMediaChannel to Tp::createFarsightChannel, then hook up
  the resulting TfChannel to a GStreamer pipeline of their choice.

* StreamedMediaChannel has a new handlerStreamingRequired method so you can
  check whether the handler needs to carry out the streaming

* fd.o #21336: Channels now indicate whether a message is expected when
  doing various Group operations

* fd.o #21337: Account supports the new HasBeenOnline property

Fixes:

* fd.o #20583: Contact objects don't work without the Contacts interface.

* fd.o #20584: Contact object creation doesn't survive bad IDs or handles.

telepathy-qt4 0.1.2 (2009-03-23)
================================

The "robotic automatic hoover" release.

Dependencies:

* Full regression tests now require telepathy-glib >= 0.7.27 (telepathy-glib
  is still optional)

* telepathy-farsight >= 0.0.4 is a new optional dependency

API changes:

* AccountManager, Account, ConnectionManager, Connection, Channel
  now inherit QSharedData and are used together with
  QExplicitlySharedDataPointer.
  This is needed so we can create shared pointers based on the object itself,
  instead of doing hacks to find the shared pointer related to a given object.
  See http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/telepathy/2009-March/003168.html for
  more details.

* Channel Features are now Feature objects, not integers

* The Feature class is now in its own header, <TelepathyQt4/Feature>

Enhancements:

* The skeletal StreamedMediaChannel class from 0.1.0 has been expanded to
  cover all the functionality of the Telepathy StreamedMedia interface

* PendingConnection, PendingAccount etc. have busName and objectPath
  methods where necessary, so that objects of custom classes can be
  constructed

* Features can now be considered critical, meaning that failure to set them up
  leads to failure of becomeReady() - this should only be used for features
  that should never fail unless the service is buggy, like Connection and
  Channel core functionality

* examples/call/ is an example of how to use StreamedMediaChannel, which can
  make and receive XMPP Jingle calls using telepathy-gabble
  (this feature requires telepathy-farsight and GStreamer)

Fixes:

* When introspection of a Feature fails, the D-Bus error is propagated as the
  failure reason of becomeReady()

* Fix a memory leak in TextChannel

telepathy-qt4 0.1.1 (2009-03-05)
================================

The "PresencePublicationAuthorizationRequestRejection" release.

API changes:

* PendingReadyAccount, PendingReadyAccountManager, PendingReadyConnection,
  PendingReadyConnectionManager have all been replaced by the PendingReady
  class

* Account, AccountManager, Connection and ConnectionManager features are now
  QSet<uint>, not bitfields

* Plural contacts are generally represented by a QSet<QSharedPointer<Contact> >
  instead of a QList<QSharedPointer<Contact> > (with a new typedef,
  Telepathy::Client::Contacts, which must be used in signal/slot connections)

Enhancements:

* Added Connection::FeatureRoster, which, when enabled, adds contact list
  (a.k.a. roster/buddy list) functionality to the ContactManager and
  Contact objects

* Improved maintainability of Account, AccountManager, Connection and
  ConnectionManager becoming ready

* A QSharedPointer<Contact> is now hashable with qHash, meaning contacts can
  be QSet or QHash members

* Added a trivial contact list user interface, examples/roster/roster

Fixes:

* The client library no longer attempts to enforce group add/remove flags:
  whatever change the user requests is passed on to the connection manager
  (which might reject it)

* PendingReady objects returned by Connection::becomeReady() have the
  Connection as parent, rather than an internal object that isn't useful
  to library users

telepathy-qt4 0.1.0 (2009-02-26)
================================

The "pending operation" release.

This first release of telepathy-qt4 features high-level API for the following:

* Manipulating accounts on a Telepathy AccountManager implementation as
  described by telepathy-spec 0.17.x, such as Mission Control 5 (beta versions
  currently available)

* Manipulating Telepathy connection managers via the ConnectionManager and
  Connection core API

* Setting your own presence on a connection manager supporting the
  SimplePresence interface

* Requesting channels from a connection manager supporting the Requests
  interface

* Reading contacts' aliases etc. on a connection manager supporting the
  Contacts interface

* Sending and receiving messages on Text channels, with or without the
  Messages interface

In addition, lower-level auto-generated accessors are provided for all the
functionality of telepathy-spec version 0.17.19.

Notable functionality that is currently missing, but will be added soon,
includes:

* Manipulating a server-stored contact list

* Controlling VoIP calls in StreamedMedia channels

/* ex: set textwidth=80: */
