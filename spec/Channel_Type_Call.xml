        A set of flags representing the status of the call as a whole,

        sense in a particular state.

      <tp:flag suffix="Locally_Ringing" value="1">
        <tp:docstring>
          The local contact has been alerted about the call but has not
          responded; if possible, the remote contact(s) have been informed of
          this fact. This flag only makes sense on incoming calls in
          state Call_State_Pending_Receiver. It SHOULD be set when
          <tp:member-ref>Ringing</tp:member-ref> is called successfully, and
          unset when the state changes.
        </tp:docstring>

      <tp:flag suffix="Queued" value="2">
        <tp:docstring>
          The contact is temporarily unavailable, and the call has been placed
          in a queue (e.g. 182 Queued in SIP, or call-waiting in telephony).
          This flag only makes sense on outgoing 1-1 calls in
          state Call_State_Pending_Receiver. It SHOULD be set or unset
          according to informational messages from other contacts.
        </tp:docstring>

      <tp:flag suffix="Locally_Held" value="4">
        <tp:docstring>
          The call has been put on hold by the local user, e.g. using the
          <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Interface"
            >Hold</tp:dbus-ref> interface. This flag SHOULD only be set if
          there is at least one Content, and all Contents are locally held;
          it makes sense on calls in state Call_State_Pending_Receiver or
          Call_State_Accepted.

          <tp:rationale>
            Otherwise, in transient situations where some but not all contents
            are on hold, UIs would falsely indicate that the call as a whole
            is on hold, which could lead to the user saying something they'll
            regret, while under the impression that the other contacts can't
            hear them!

      <tp:flag suffix="Forwarded" value="8">
        <tp:docstring>
          The initiator of the call originally called a contact other than the
          current recipient of the call, but the call was then forwarded or
          diverted. This flag only makes sense on outgoing calls, in state
          Call_State_Pending_Receiver or Call_State_Accepted. It SHOULD be
          set or unset according to informational messages from other contacts.
        </tp:docstring>
      </tp:flag>

      <tp:flag suffix="In_Progress" value="16">
        <tp:docstring>
          Progress has been made in placing the outgoing call, but the
          contact may not have been made aware of the call yet
          (so the Ringing state is not appropriate). This corresponds to SIP's
          status code 183 Session Progress, and could be used when the
          outgoing call has reached a gateway, for instance.
          This flag only makes sense on outgoing calls in state
          Call_State_Pending_Receiver, and SHOULD be set or unset according to
          informational messages from servers, gateways and other
          infrastructure.
        </tp:docstring>
      </tp:flag>

      <tp:flag suffix="Clearing" value="32">
        <tp:docstring>
          This flag only occurs when the CallState is Ended. The call with
          this flag set has ended, but not all resources corresponding to the
          call have been freed yet.

          Depending on the protocol there might be some audible feedback while
          the clearing flag is set.

          <tp:rationale>
            In calls following the ITU-T Q.931 standard there is a period of
            time between the call ending and the underlying channel being
            completely free for re-use.

      <tp:docstring>
        <p>The client supports media streaming with H264 (etc.).</p>

        <p>This handler capability token is a one of a family
          of similar tokens: for any other audio or video codec whose MIME
          type is audio/<em>subtype</em> or video/<em>subtype</em>, a handler
          capability token of this form may exist (the subtype MUST appear
          in lower case in this context). Clients MAY support more
          codecs than they explicitly advertise support for; clients SHOULD
          explicitly advertise support for their preferred codec(s), and
          for codecs like H264 that are, in practice, significant in codec
          negotiation.</p>

        <tp:rationale>
          <p>For instance, the XMPP capability used by the Google Video
            Chat web client to determine whether a client is compatible
            with it requires support for H264 video, so an XMPP
            connection manager that supports this version of Jingle should
            not advertise the Google Video Chat capability unless there
            is at least one installed client that declares that it supports
            <code>video/h264</code> on Call channels.</p>
        </tp:rationale>

        <p>For example, a client could advertise support for
          Speex, Theora and H264 by having three
          handler capability tokens,
          <code>org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Type.Call.DRAFT/audio/speex</code>,
          <code>org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Type.Call.DRAFT/video/theora</code> and
          <code>org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Type.Call.DRAFT/video/h264</code>,
          in its <tp:dbus-ref
            namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client.Handler">Capabilities</tp:dbus-ref>
          property.</p>

        <p>Clients MAY have media signalling abilities without explicitly
          supporting any particular codec, and connection managers SHOULD
          support this usage.</p>

        <tp:rationale>
          <p>This is necessary to support gatewaying between two Telepathy
            connections, in which case the available codecs might not be
            known to the gatewaying process.</p>
