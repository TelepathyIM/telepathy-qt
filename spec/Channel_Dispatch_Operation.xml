  <interface name="im.telepathy.v1.ChannelDispatchOperation">
    <tp:added version="0.17.26">(as a stable interface)</tp:added>

    <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <p>A channel dispatch operation is an object in the ChannelDispatcher
        representing an unrequested channel being announced to
        client
        <tp:dbus-ref namespace="im.telepathy.v1.Client">Approver</tp:dbus-ref>
        processes.</p>

      <p>These objects can result from new incoming channels or channels
        which are automatically created for some reason, but cannot result
        from outgoing requests for channels.</p>

      <p>More specifically, whenever the <tp:dbus-ref
        namespace="im.telepathy.v1">Connection.Interface.Requests.NewChannel</tp:dbus-ref>
        signal contains a channel whose <tp:dbus-ref
        namespace="im.telepathy.v1.Channel">Requested</tp:dbus-ref>
        property is false, a ChannelDispatchOperation
        object is created for that channel.</p>

      <p>If no handler at all can handle a channel, the channel dispatcher
        SHOULD terminate that channel instead of creating a channel dispatcher
        for it. It is RECOMMENDED that the channel dispatcher closes
        the channel using <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="im.telepathy.v1">Channel.Interface.Destroyable1.Destroy</tp:dbus-ref>
        if supported, or <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="im.telepathy.v1">Channel.Close</tp:dbus-ref>
        otherwise.</p>

      <p>If a handler with <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="im.telepathy.v1.Client.Handler">BypassApproval</tp:dbus-ref>
        <code>= True</code> could handle the channel in the dispatch
        operation, then the channel dispatcher SHOULD call <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="im.telepathy.v1.Client.Handler">HandleChannel</tp:dbus-ref>
        on that handler, and (assuming the call succeeds) emit
        <tp:member-ref>Finished</tp:member-ref> and stop processing that
        channel without involving any approvers.</p>

      <tp:rationale>
        <p>Some channel types can be picked up "quietly" by an existing
          channel handler. If a <tp:dbus-ref
            namespace="im.telepathy.v1.Channel.Type">Text</tp:dbus-ref>
          channel is added to an existing bundle containing a <tp:dbus-ref
            namespace="im.telepathy.v1.Channel.Type">Call1</tp:dbus-ref>
          channel, there shouldn't be
          any approvers, flashing icons or notification bubbles, if the
          the UI for the Call channel can just add a text box
          and display the message.</p>
      </tp:rationale>

      <p>Otherwise, the channel dispatcher SHOULD send the channel dispatch
        operation to all relevant approvers (in parallel) and wait for an
        approver to claim the channel or request that it is handled.
        See
        <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="im.telepathy.v1.Client.Approver">AddDispatchOperation</tp:dbus-ref>
        for more details on this.</p>

      <p>Finally, if the approver requested it, the channel dispatcher SHOULD
        send the channel to a handler.</p>

        <p>However, this method may fail because the dispatch has already been

    <method name="Claim" tp:name-for-bindings="Claim">

        <p>Called by an approver to claim channels for handling
          internally. If this method is called successfully, the process
          calling this method becomes the handler for the channel, but
          <em>does not</em> have the <tp:dbus-ref
            namespace="im.telepathy.v1.Client.Handler">HandleChannel</tp:dbus-ref>
          method called on it.</p>

        <p>Clients that call Claim on channels but do not immediately
          close them SHOULD implement the Handler interface and its
          <tp:dbus-ref
            namespace="im.telepathy.v1.Client.Handler">HandledChannels</tp:dbus-ref>
          property.</p>

        <p>Approvers wishing to reject channels MUST call this method to
          claim ownership of them, and MUST NOT call
          <tp:dbus-ref namespace="im.telepathy.v1.Channel">Close</tp:dbus-ref>
          on the channels unless/until this method returns successfully.</p>

        <tp:rationale>
          <p>The channel dispatcher can't know how best to close arbitrary
            channel types, so it leaves it up to the approver to do so.
            For instance, for Text channels it is necessary
            to acknowledge any messages that have already been displayed to
            the user first - ideally, the approver would display and then
            acknowledge the messages - or to call <tp:dbus-ref
              namespace="im.telepathy.v1">Channel.Interface.Destroyable1.Destroy</tp:dbus-ref>
            if the destructive behaviour of that method is desired.</p>

          <p>Similarly, an Approver for <tp:dbus-ref
            namespace="imt1.Channel.Type">Call1</tp:dbus-ref> channels
            can close the channel with a reason (e.g. "busy") if
            desired. The channel dispatcher, which is designed to have
            no specific knowledge of particular channel types, can't
            do that.</p>
        </tp:rationale>

        <p>If successful, this method will cause the ChannelDispatchOperation
          object to disappear, emitting
          <tp:member-ref>Finished</tp:member-ref>, in the same way as for
          <tp:member-ref>HandleWith</tp:member-ref>.</p>

        <p>This method may fail because the dispatch operation has already
          been completed. Again, see HandleWith for more details. The approver
