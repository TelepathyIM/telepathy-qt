  <interface name="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.ChannelDispatchOperation">
    <tp:added version="0.17.26">(as a stable interface)</tp:added>

    <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <p>A channel dispatch operation is an object in the ChannelDispatcher
        representing a batch of unrequested channels being announced to
        client
        <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client">Approver</tp:dbus-ref>
        processes.</p>

      <p>These objects can result from new incoming channels or channels
        which are automatically created for some reason, but cannot result
        from outgoing requests for channels.</p>

      <p>More specifically, whenever the
        <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy">Connection.Interface.Requests.NewChannels</tp:dbus-ref>
        signal contains channels whose
        <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel">Requested</tp:dbus-ref>
        property is false, or whenever the
        <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy">Connection.NewChannel</tp:dbus-ref>
        signal contains a channel with suppress_handler false,
        one or more ChannelDispatchOperation objects are created for those
        channels.</p>

      <p>(If some channels in a NewChannels signal are in different bundles,
        this is an error. The channel dispatcher SHOULD recover by treating
        the NewChannels signal as if it had been several NewChannels signals
        each containing one channel.)</p>

      <p>First, the channel dispatcher SHOULD construct a list of all the
        <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client">Handler</tp:dbus-ref>s
        that could handle all the channels (based on their <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client.Handler">HandlerChannelFilter</tp:dbus-ref>
        property), ordered by
        priority in some implementation-dependent way. If there are handlers
        which could handle all the channels, one channel dispatch operation
        SHOULD be created for all the channels. If there are not, one channel
        dispatch operation SHOULD be created for each channel, each with
        a list of channel handlers that could handle that channel.</p>

      <p>If no handler at all can handle a channel, the channel dispatcher
        SHOULD terminate that channel instead of creating a channel dispatcher
        for it. It is RECOMMENDED that the channel dispatcher closes
        the channels using <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy">Channel.Interface.Destroyable.Destroy</tp:dbus-ref>
        if supported, or <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy">Channel.Close</tp:dbus-ref>
        otherwise. As a special case, the channel dispatcher SHOULD NOT close
        <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Type">ContactList</tp:dbus-ref>
        channels, and if Close fails, the channel dispatcher SHOULD ignore
        that channel.</p>

      <tp:rationale>
        <p>ContactList channels are strange. We hope to replace them with
          something better, such as an interface on the Connection, in a
          future version of this specification.</p>
      </tp:rationale>

      <p>When listing channel handlers, priority SHOULD be given to
        channel handlers that are already handling channels from the same
        bundle.</p>

      <p>If a handler with <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client.Handler">BypassApproval</tp:dbus-ref>
        <code>= True</code> could handle all of the channels in the dispatch
        operation, then the channel dispatcher SHOULD call <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client.Handler">HandleChannels</tp:dbus-ref>
        on that handler, and (assuming the call succeeds) emit
        <tp:member-ref>Finished</tp:member-ref> and stop processing those
        channels without involving any approvers.</p>

      <tp:rationale>
        <p>Some channel types can be picked up "quietly" by an existing
          channel handler. If a <tp:dbus-ref
            namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Type">Text</tp:dbus-ref>
          channel is added to an existing bundle containing a <tp:dbus-ref
            namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Type">StreamedMedia</tp:dbus-ref>
          channel, there shouldn't be
          any approvers, flashing icons or notification bubbles, if the
          the UI for the StreamedMedia channel can just add a text box
          and display the message.</p>
      </tp:rationale>

      <p>Otherwise, the channel dispatcher SHOULD send the channel dispatch
        operation to all relevant approvers (in parallel) and wait for an
        approver to claim the channels or request that they are handled.
        See
        <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client.Approver">AddDispatchOperation</tp:dbus-ref>
        for more details on this.</p>

      <p>Finally, if the approver requested it, the channel dispatcher SHOULD
        send the channels to a handler.</p>

            At the time that HandleWith was called, this dispatch operation was
            processing an earlier call to HandleWith. The earlier call has
            now succeeded, so some Handler nominated by another approver is
            now responsible for the channels. In this situation, the second
            call to HandleWith MUST NOT return until the first one has
            returned successfully or unsuccessfully, and if the first call
            to HandleChannels fails, the channel dispatcher SHOULD try to obey
            the choice of Handler made by the second call to HandleWith.

    <signal name="Finished" tp:name-for-bindings="Finished">
      <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>Emitted when this dispatch operation finishes. The dispatch
          operation is no longer present and further methods must not be
          called on it.</p>

        <p>Approvers that have a user interface SHOULD stop notifying the user
          about the channels in response to this signal; they MAY assume that
          on errors, they would have received
          <tp:member-ref>ChannelLost</tp:member-ref> first.</p>

        <p>Its object path SHOULD NOT be reused for a subsequent dispatch
          operation; the ChannelDispatcher MUST choose object paths
          in a way that avoids immediate re-use.</p>

        <tp:rationale>
          <p>Otherwise, clients might accidentally call
            <tp:member-ref>HandleWith</tp:member-ref> or
            <tp:member-ref>Claim</tp:member-ref> on a new dispatch operation
            instead of the one they intended to handle.</p>
        </tp:rationale>

        <p>This signal MUST NOT be emitted until all Approvers that were
          invoked have returned (successfully or with an error) from
          their <tp:dbus-ref
            namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client.Approver">AddDispatchOperation</tp:dbus-ref>
          method.</p>

        <tp:rationale>
          <p>This means that Approvers can connect to the ChannelLost signal
            in a race-free way. Non-approver processes that discover
            a channel dispatch operation in some way (such as observers)
            will have to follow the usual "connect to signals then recover
            state" model - first connect to
            <tp:member-ref>ChannelLost</tp:member-ref> and
            Finished, then download <tp:member-ref>Channels</tp:member-ref>
            (and on error, perhaps assume that the operation has already
            Finished).</p>
