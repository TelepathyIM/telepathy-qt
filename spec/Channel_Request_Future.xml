      <p>This interface contains functionality which we intend to incorporate
        into the <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy">ChannelRequest</tp:dbus-ref>
        interface in future. It should be considered to
        be conceptually part of the core ChannelRequest interface, but without
        API or ABI guarantees.</p>

    <property name="Hints" tp:name-for-bindings="Hints"

      <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>A dictionary of metadata provided by the channel
          requester, which the handler and other clients MAY choose to
          interpret.  Currently no standard keys are defined; clients MAY
          choose to use platform-specific keys for their own purposes, but MUST
          ignore unknown keys and MUST cope with expected keys being
          missing.</p>

        <tp:rationale>This property might be used to pass a contact ID for a
          telephone number shared between two contacts from the address book to
          the call UI, so that if you try to call “Mum”, the call UI knows this
          rather than having to guess or show “Calling Mum or Dad”. The format
          of these contact IDs would be platform-specific, so we leave the
          definition of the dictionary entry up to the platform in question.
          But third-party channel requesters might not include the contact ID,
          so the call UI has to be able to deal with it not being
          there.</tp:rationale>

        <p>The channel dispatcher will not interpret these hints: they are
          solely for communication between cooperating clients.</p>

        <tp:rationale>
          <p>Any extra parameters that do affect the channel dispatcher should
            be designed separately.</p>
        </tp:rationale>

        <p>This property may be set when the channel request is created, and
          can never change. Since it is immutable, it SHOULD be included in the
          dictionary of properties passed to <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="ofdT.Client.Interface.Requests">AddRequest</tp:dbus-ref>
          by the <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy">ChannelDispatcher</tp:dbus-ref>.</p>
