  <interface name="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.FUTURE"
    tp:causes-havoc="a staging area for future Channel functionality">

    <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <p>This interface contains functionality which we intend to incorporate
        into the <tp:dbus-ref
        namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy">Channel</tp:dbus-ref> interface
        in future. It should be considered to
        be conceptually part of the core Channel interface, but without
        API or ABI guarantees.</p>

      <tp:rationale>
        <p>If we add new functionality to the Channel interface, libraries
          that use generated code (notably telepathy-glib) will have it as
          part of their ABI forever, meaning we can't make incompatible
          changes. By using this interface as a staging area for future
          Channel functionality, we can try out new properties, signals
          and methods as application-specific extensions, then merge them
          into the core Channel interface when we have enough implementation
          experience to declare them to be stable.</p>

        <p>The name is by analogy to Python's <code>__future__</code>
          pseudo-module.</p>

        <p>A channel's Bundle property can never change.</p>

        <p>Older connection managers might not have this property. Clients
          (particularly the channel dispatcher) SHOULD recover by considering
          each channel to be in a bundle containing only that channel,
          distinct from all other bundles, which has no additional
          interfaces.</p>
