      <p>The account manager is a central service used to store account
        details.</p>

      <p>The current account manager is defined to be the process that owns
        the well-known bus name org.freedesktop.Telepathy.AccountManager on
        the session bus. This process must export an
        /org/freedesktop/Telepathy/AccountManager object with the
        AccountManager interface.</p>

    <!-- Missing functionality compared with NMC 4.x:
    * look up accounts by conditions (can be done client-side, less
      efficiently, so not a blocker)
    * global presence/... changes (can be done client-side, less efficiently -
      we should add this)
    * count used channels (what's this for?)
    * get "average" status (not well-defined, UIs can do this)
    * request channels (out of scope: Channel Dispatcher will do this)
    * register filters (completely out of scope: Channel Dispatcher again)

    <property name="Interfaces" type="as" access="read">
      <tp:docstring>
        A list of the interfaces provided by the account manager object.
      </tp:docstring>
    </property>

    <property name="ValidAccounts" type="ao" access="read">
      <tp:docstring>
        A list of the valid (complete, usable) accounts. Change notification
        is via AccountValidityChanged.

        <tp:rationale>
          This split between valid and invalid accounts makes it easy to
          ignore the invalid ones. The only things that should be manipulating
          invalid accounts are account-editing UIs, which might be able to
          rescue them.

    <property name="InvalidAccounts" type="ao" access="read">

    <signal name="AccountValidityChanged">
      <tp:docstring>
        The validity of the given account has changed. New accounts are
        also indicated by this signal, as an account validity change
        (usually to True) on an account that did not previously exist.

        <tp:rationale>
