        <p>When requesting a channel with a particular value for this

        <p>This is fixed for the lifetime of the channel, so channels which

          handle), must have TargetEntityType set to Entity_Type_None and
          TargetHandle set to 0.</p>

        <p>Unlike in the telepathy-spec 0.16 API, there is no particular
          uniqueness guarantee - there can be many channels with the same
          (channel type, handle type, handle) tuple. This is necessary
          to support conversation threads in XMPP and SIP, for example.</p>

        <p>If this is present in a channel request, it must be nonzero,

            it could communicate with the specified handle in some other way
            (e.g. have the requested contact handle in its Group

        <tp:rationale>
          <p>The idea of this property is to distinguish between "incoming"
            and "outgoing" channels, in a way that doesn't break down when
            considering special cases like contact lists that are automatically
            created on connection to the server, or chatrooms that an
            IRC proxy/bouncer like irssi-proxy or bip was already in.</p>

          <p>The reason we want to make that distinction is that UIs for
            things that the user explicitly requested should start up
            automatically, whereas for incoming messages and VoIP calls we
            should first ask the user whether they want to open the messaging

        <p>If the channel was not explicitly requested (even if it was
          created as a side-effect of a call to one of those functions,
          e.g. because joining a Tube in a MUC context on XMPP implies
          joining that MUC), then this property is false.</p>

        <p>It does not make sense for this property to be in channel
          requests—it will always be true for channels returned by
          CreateChannel, and callers of EnsureChannel cannot control whether an
          existing channel was originally requested locally—so it MUST NOT
          be accepted.</p>

        <p>The contact who initiated the channel; for instance, the contact
          who invited the local user to a chatroom, or the contact who
          initiated a call.</p>

        <p>This does <em>not</em> necessarily represent the contact who
          created the underlying protocol-level construct. For instance, if
          Rob creates a chatroom, Will joins that chatroom, and Will invites Simon
          to join it, then Simon will see Will as the InitiatorHandle of the
          channel representing the chatroom.</p>

        <tp:rationale>
          <p>The room creator is generally a less useful piece of information
            than the inviter, is less likely to be available at invitation
            time (i.e. can't necessarily be an immutable property), and is
            less likely to be available at all. The creator of a chatroom
            is not currently available via Telepathy; if added in future, it
            is likely to be made available as a property on the Chatroom
            interface (<a
              href="http://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=23151">bug 23151</a>).</p>
        </tp:rationale>

        <p>For channels requested by the

          <tp:dbus-ref namespace="im.telepathy.v1">Connection.SelfHandle</tp:dbus-ref>

          <p>On some protocols, the SelfHandle may change (as signalled by
            <tp:dbus-ref
              namespace="im.telepathy.v1">Connection.SelfContactChanged</tp:dbus-ref>),
            but this property is immutable. Hence, locally-requested channels'
            InitiatorHandle and InitiatorID may not match the current
            SelfHandle; <tp:member-ref>Requested</tp:member-ref> can be used to
            determine whether the channel was created locally.</p>
        </tp:rationale>

        <p>For channels requested by a remote user, this MUST be their handle.
          If unavailable or not applicable, this MUST be 0 (for instance,
          contact lists are not really initiated by anyone in particular, and
          it's easy to imagine a protocol where chatroom invitations can be
          anonymous).</p>

        <p>For channels with the <tp:dbus-ref
            namespace="im.telepathy.v1.Channel.Interface">Group1</tp:dbus-ref>
          interface, this SHOULD be the same
          contact who is signalled as the "Actor" causing the self-handle
          to be placed in the local-pending set.</p>

        <p>This SHOULD NOT be a channel-specific handle, if possible.</p>

        <p>It does not make sense for this property to be in channel

    <p>
      All communication in the Telepathy framework is carried out via
      channel objects which are created and managed by
      connections. This interface must be implemented by all channel
      objects, along with one single channel type, such as
      <tp:dbus-ref
      namespace="im.telepathy.v1">Channel.Type.Text</tp:dbus-ref> which
      represents a channel over which textual messages are sent and
      received.</p>

    <p>Each Channel's object path MUST start with the object path of
      its associated <tp:dbus-ref
      namespace="im.telepathy.v1">Connection</tp:dbus-ref>, followed
      by '/'. There MAY be any number of additional object-path components,
      which clients MUST NOT attempt to parse.</p>

    <tp:rationale>
      <p>This ensures that Channel object paths are unique, even between
        Connections and CMs, because Connection object paths are
        guaranteed-unique via their link to the well-known bus name.</p>

      <p>If all connection managers in use are known to comply with at least
        spec version 0.17.10, then the Connection's object path can
        even be determined from the Channel's without any additional
        information, by taking the first 7 components.</p>
    </tp:rationale>

    <p>Each channel has a number of immutable properties (which cannot vary
      after the channel has been announced with <tp:dbus-ref
        namespace='imt1.Connection.Interface.Requests'>NewChannel</tp:dbus-ref>),
      provided to clients in the
      <tp:dbus-ref namespace='imt1.Client.Observer'>ObserveChannel</tp:dbus-ref>,
      <tp:dbus-ref namespace='imt1.Client.Approver'>AddDispatchOperation</tp:dbus-ref> and
      <tp:dbus-ref namespace='imt1.Client.Handler'>HandleChannel</tp:dbus-ref>
      methods to permit immediate identification of the channel. This interface
      contains immutable properties common to all channels. In brief:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><tp:member-ref>ChannelType</tp:member-ref> specifies the kind of
        communication carried out on this channel;</li>
      <li><tp:member-ref>TargetEntityType</tp:member-ref>,
        <tp:member-ref>TargetHandle</tp:member-ref> and
        <tp:member-ref>TargetID</tp:member-ref> specify the entity with which
        this channel communicates, such as the other party in a 1-1 call, or
        the name of a multi-user chat room;</li>
      <li><tp:member-ref>InitiatorHandle</tp:member-ref> and
        <tp:member-ref>InitiatorID</tp:member-ref> specify who created this
        channel;</li>
      <li><tp:member-ref>Requested</tp:member-ref> indicates whether the local
        user requested this channel, or whether it is an incoming call, a text
        conversation started by a remote contact, a chatroom invitation,
        etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Other optional <tp:member-ref>Interfaces</tp:member-ref> can be
      implemented to indicate other available
      functionality, such as <tp:dbus-ref
        namespace="im.telepathy.v1">Channel.Interface.Group1</tp:dbus-ref>
      if the channel contains a number of contacts, <tp:dbus-ref
        namespace="im.telepathy.v1">Channel.Interface.Password1</tp:dbus-ref>
      to indicate that a channel may have a password set to require entry, and
      <tp:dbus-ref
        namespace="im.telepathy.v1">Channel.Interface.ChatState1</tp:dbus-ref>
      for typing notifications. The interfaces implemented may not vary after
      the channel has been created. These other interfaces (along with the
      interface named by <tp:member-ref>ChannelType</tp:member-ref>) may
      themselves specify immutable properties to be announced up-front along
      with the properties on this interface.</p>

    <p>Some channels are “anonymous”, with
      <tp:member-ref>TargetEntityType</tp:member-ref> set to <code>None</code>,
      which indicates that the channel is defined by some other properties. For
      instance, transient ad-hoc chat rooms may be defined only by their members (as visible
      through the <tp:dbus-ref
        namespace="imt1.Channel.Interface">Group1</tp:dbus-ref>
      interface), and <tp:dbus-ref
        namespace='imt1.Channel.Type'>ContactSearch1</tp:dbus-ref>
      channels represent a single search attempt for a particular <tp:dbus-ref
        namespace='imt1.Channel.Type.ContactSearch1'>Server</tp:dbus-ref>.</p>

    <p>Specific connection manager implementations may implement channel types and
    interfaces which are not contained within this specification in order to
    support further functionality. To aid interoperability between client and
    connection manager implementations, the interfaces specified here should be
    used wherever applicable, and new interfaces made protocol-independent
    wherever possible. Because of the potential for 3rd party interfaces adding
    methods or signals with conflicting names, the D-Bus interface names should
    always be used to invoke methods and bind signals.</p>
