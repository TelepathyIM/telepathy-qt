  <interface name="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Account">
    <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <p>An Account object encapsulates the necessary details to make a
        Telepathy connection.</p>

      <p>Accounts are uniquely identified by object path. The object path
        of an Account MUST take the form
        <code>/org/freedesktop/Telepathy/Account/<em>cm</em>/<em>proto</em>/<em>acct</em></code>, where:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><em>cm</em> is the same <tp:type>Connection_Manager_Name</tp:type>
          that appears in the connection manager's well-known bus name and
          object path</li>
        <li><em>proto</em> is the <tp:type>Protocol</tp:type> name as seen in
          <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy">ConnectionManager.ListProtocols</tp:dbus-ref>,
          but with "-" replaced with "_"
          (i.e. the same as in the object-path of a <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy">Connection</tp:dbus-ref>)</li>
        <li><em>acct</em> is an arbitrary string of ASCII letters, digits
          and underscores, starting with a letter or underscore, which
          uniquely identifies this account</li>
        <li>Clients SHOULD parse the object path to discover the
          connection manager and protocol</li>
        <li>Clients MUST NOT attempt to parse <em>acct</em></li>
        <li>Clients MUST NOT assume that <em>acct</em> matches
          the connection-specific part of a Connection's object-path and
          bus name</li>
        <li>The account manager SHOULD choose <em>acct</em> such that if
          an account is deleted, its object path will be re-used if and only
          if the new account is in some sense "the same"
          (incorporating the 'account' parameter in some way is
          recommended)</li>
      </ul>

      <tp:rationale>
        <p>This API avoids specifying the "profiles" used in Mission Control
          4.x or the "presets" that have been proposed to replace them. An
          optional interface will be provided for AM implementations
          that want to provide presets.</p>

        <p>There is deliberately no functionality here for opening channels;
          we intend to provide that in the channel dispatcher.</p>

        <p>Other missing features which would be better in their own
          interfaces:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>dynamic parameter-providing (aka provisioning)</li>
          <li>saved server capabilities</li>
          <li>account conditions</li>
          <li>account grouping</li>

    <!-- Missing functionality compared with NMC 4.x account + profile,
    apart from as listed above:

    * vCard field, + default profile for each vCard field
      (vCard field is per protocol and should be chosen by the
      Telepathy <-> address-book bridge?; default profile is now
      meaningless)

    * "normalized name" (normalized handle?)

    * branding icon (what's this and how does it differ from the icon?)

    * configuration UI (not our problem - perhaps the UI could special-case
      by cm,protocol,preset tuples?)

    * default account domain (somewhat meaningless in general; specialized
      account config UI can hard-code this)

    * SPLIT_ACCOUNT (pseudo-capability - this is a property of the protocol,
      not the profile, and in any case only the account config UI cares)

    Missing functionality compared with Decibel accounts:

    * we don't really know, they take arbitrary key/value pairs...
      but display name, protocol, presence/message, current, autoreconnect
      are the ones given special status by the source, and we have all of them

        might be caused by the absence of a required parameter).

        <tp:rationale>
          For connection managers with a plugin architecture, like
          telepathy-haze, we have little or no control over the parameters
          offered; for platforms with package management, we have little or
          no control over the CMs offered. NMC 4.x would just pretend the
          account didn't exist in these circumstances, but silent data loss
          is bad, and UIs with CM-specific knowledge (or a user filling in
          newly-required parameters) might be able to rescue a broken account.

            <li>There is some temporary server error and the user doesn't want

        <p>The AccountManager SHOULD allow this property to be set on invalid

        if appropriate.

        <tp:rationale>
          In a later specification revision, we plan to separate the concepts
          of a contact's nickname as set by themselves, and the local
          name for them in our contact list (a "handle" or "pet name" as
          described in XEP-0165 and its references). The terminology change
          from alias to nickname here is a step in that direction.

        <p>Some protocols, like XMPP and SIP, are used by various different
          user-recognised brands, such as <i>Google Talk</i> and <i>Ovi by
          Nokia</i>. On accounts for such services, this property SHOULD be
          set to a string describing the service, which MUST consist only of
          ASCII letters, numbers and hyphen/minus signs, and start with a
          letter (matching the requirements for <tp:type>Protocol</tp:type>).
          For the <tt>jabber</tt> protocol, one of the following service names
          should be used if possible:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><tt>google-talk</tt> (for <a
            href="http://www.google.com/talk/">Google's IM service</a>)</li>
          <li><tt>ovi-chat</tt> (for <a href="http://www.ovi.com/">Ovi</a>'s IM
            service)</li>

          <tt>gimpnet</tt>, etc.) can be used if relevant.</p>

        <p>The <tp:member-ref>Icon</tp:member-ref> property SHOULD be set to a
          corresponding brand-specific icon name, if possible. In the future,
          this property may be used as an index into additional
          service-specific customizations. If this property is the empty string
          (or missing), the service is determined by the protocol name (either
          because this is a single-service protocol like <tt>msn</tt>, or
          because this is just a generic <tt>jabber</tt> or <tt>sip</tt>
          account without specific branding).</p>
