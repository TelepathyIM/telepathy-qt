  <interface name="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Account">
    <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <p>An Account object encapsulates the necessary details to make a
        Telepathy connection.</p>

      <p>Accounts are uniquely identified by object path. The object path
        of an Account MUST take the form
        <code>/org/freedesktop/Telepathy/Account/<em>cm</em>/<em>proto</em>/<em>acct</em></code>, where:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><em>cm</em> is the same <tp:type>Connection_Manager_Name</tp:type>
          that appears in the connection manager's well-known bus name and
          object path</li>
        <li><em>proto</em> is the <tp:type>Protocol</tp:type> name as seen in
          <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy">ConnectionManager.ListProtocols</tp:dbus-ref>,
          but with "-" replaced with "_"
          (i.e. the same as in the object-path of a <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy">Connection</tp:dbus-ref>)</li>
        <li><em>acct</em> is an arbitrary string of ASCII letters, digits
          and underscores, starting with a letter or underscore, which
          uniquely identifies this account</li>
        <li>Clients SHOULD parse the object path to discover the
          connection manager and protocol</li>
        <li>Clients MUST NOT attempt to parse <em>acct</em></li>
        <li>Clients MUST NOT assume that <em>acct</em> matches
          the connection-specific part of a Connection's object-path and
          bus name</li>
        <li>The account manager SHOULD choose <em>acct</em> such that if
          an account is deleted, its object path will be re-used if and only
          if the new account is in some sense "the same"
          (incorporating the 'account' parameter in some way is
          recommended)</li>
      </ul>

      <tp:rationale>
        <p>This API avoids specifying the "profiles" used in Mission Control
          4.x or the "presets" that have been proposed to replace them. An
          optional interface will be provided for AM implementations
          that want to provide presets.</p>

        <p>There is deliberately no functionality here for opening channels;
          we intend to provide that in the channel dispatcher.</p>

        <p>Other missing features which would be better in their own
          interfaces:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>dynamic parameter-providing (aka provisioning)</li>
          <li>saved server capabilities</li>
          <li>account conditions</li>
          <li>account grouping</li>

    <!-- Missing functionality compared with NMC 4.x account + profile,
    apart from as listed above:

    * vCard field, + default profile for each vCard field
      (vCard field is per protocol and should be chosen by the
      Telepathy <-> address-book bridge?; default profile is now
      meaningless)

    * "normalized name" (normalized handle?)

    * branding icon (what's this and how does it differ from the icon?)

    * configuration UI (not our problem - perhaps the UI could special-case
      by cm,protocol,preset tuples?)

    * default account domain (somewhat meaningless in general; specialized
      account config UI can hard-code this)

    * SPLIT_ACCOUNT (pseudo-capability - this is a property of the protocol,
      not the profile, and in any case only the account config UI cares)

    Missing functionality compared with Decibel accounts:

    * we don't really know, they take arbitrary key/value pairs...
      but display name, protocol, presence/message, current, autoreconnect
      are the ones given special status by the source, and we have all of them

        an empty string, the account manager or any client MAY derive a
        default icon, for instance from the protocol.

        <tp:rationale>
          This approximately corresponds to mc_profile_get_icon_name
          (or possibly mc_profile_get_branding_icon_name) in NMC 4.x.
          It's accessed via the account rather than the profile because

    <property name="Valid" tp:name-for-bindings="Valid"

      <tp:docstring>
        If true, this account is considered by the account manager to be
        complete and usable. If false, user action is required to make it
        usable, and it will never attempt to connect (for instance, this
        might be caused by the absence of a required parameter).

        <tp:rationale>
          For connection managers with a plugin architecture, like
          telepathy-haze, we have little or no control over the parameters
          offered; for platforms with package management, we have little or
          no control over the CMs offered. NMC 4.x would just pretend the
          account didn't exist in these circumstances, but silent data loss
          is bad, and UIs with CM-specific knowledge (or a user filling in
          newly-required parameters) might be able to rescue a broken account.

            <li>There is some temporary server error and the user doesn't want

        <p>The AccountManager SHOULD allow this property to be set on invalid

        if appropriate.

        <tp:rationale>
          In a later specification revision, we plan to separate the concepts
          of a contact's nickname as set by themselves, and the local
          name for them in our contact list (a "handle" or "pet name" as
          described in XEP-0165 and its references). The terminology change
          from alias to nickname here is a step in that direction.

        <p>Re-connect this account. If the account is currently disconnected
          and the requested presence is offline, or if the account
          is not <tp:member-ref>Enabled</tp:member-ref> or not
          <tp:member-ref>Valid</tp:member-ref>, this does nothing.</p>

        <p>If the account is disconnected and the requested presence is not
          offline, this forces an attempt to connect with the requested
          presence immediately.</p>

        <p>If the account is connecting or connected, this is equivalent to
          remembering the current value of
          <tp:member-ref>RequestedPresence</tp:member-ref>, setting its value
          to (OFFLINE, "offline", ""), waiting for the change to take effect,
          then setting its value to the value that was previously
          remembered.</p>

          <p>Clients desiring "instant apply" semantics for CM parameters MAY
            call this method to achieve that.</p>
        </tp:rationale>

        <p>In particular, if the account's
          <tp:member-ref>Connection</tp:member-ref> is in the Connecting
          state, calling this method causes the attempt to connect to be
          aborted and re-tried.</p>

        <tp:rationale>
          <p>This is necessary to ensure that the new parameters are
            picked up.</p>

        <p>The normalized user ID of the local user on this account (i.e. the
          string returned when the <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Connection">InspectHandles</tp:dbus-ref>
          method is called on the
          result of <tp:dbus-ref

          for an active connection).</p>

        <p>It is unspecified whether this user ID is globally unique.</p>

        <tp:rationale>
          <p>As currently implemented, IRC user IDs are only unique within
            the same IRCnet. On some saner protocols, the user ID includes a
            DNS name which provides global uniqueness.</p>
        </tp:rationale>

        <p>If this value is not known yet (which will always be the case for
          accounts that have never been online), it will be an empty
          string.</p>

        <p>It is possible that this value will change if the connection
          manager's normalization algorithm changes, although this SHOULD
          be avoided.</p>

        <tp:rationale>
          <p>It's not always completely clear what normalization algorithm
            should be used; for instance, in Gabble, we currently use JIDs,
            but it would also have been reasonable to use xmpp URIs.</p>

          UIs could apply a policy that the 'account' parameter can only be
          edited in accounts that have never been online, or that
          ConnectAutomatically cannot be set on such accounts. The account
          manager should not enforce such policies, but it can expose enough
          information to UIs that the UI can decide what to do.
