    <tp:docstring>
      An interface for streamed media channels that can indicate call
      progress or call states. The presence of this interface is no guarantee
      that call states will actually be signalled (for instance, SIP
      implementations are not guaranteed to generate status 180 Ringing,
      so a call can be accepted without the Ringing flag ever having been set).
    </tp:docstring>
    <tp:added version="0.17.2"/>

    <method name="GetCallStates">
      <tp:docstring>
        Get the current call states for all contacts involved in this call.
      </tp:docstring>

      <arg tp:type="Channel_Call_State_Map" name="States" direction="out"
        type="a{uu}">
        <tp:docstring>
          The current call states. Participants where the call state flags
          would be 0 (all unset) may be omitted from this mapping.
        </tp:docstring>
      </arg>
    </method>

    <signal name="CallStateChanged">
      <tp:docstring>
        Emitted when the state of a member of the channel has changed.
      </tp:docstring>

      <arg name="contact" type="u" tp:type="Contact_Handle">
        <tp:docstring>
          An integer handle for the contact.

      </arg>

      <arg name="state" type="u" tp:type="Channel_Call_State_Flags">

          The new state for this contact.

        A map from contacts to call states.

      <tp:docstring>
        A set of flags representing call states.

      <tp:flag suffix="Ringing" value="1">
        <tp:docstring>
          The contact has been alerted about the call but has not responded
          (e.g. 180 Ringing in SIP).
        </tp:docstring>
      </tp:flag>

      <tp:flag suffix="Queued" value="2">
        <tp:docstring>
          The contact is temporarily unavailable, and the call has been placed
          in a queue (e.g. 182 Queued in SIP, or call-waiting in telephony).

          media from the local user or any other participants until they
          unhold the call again.
