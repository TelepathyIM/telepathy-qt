    <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <p>Observers monitor the creation of new channels. This
        functionality can be used for things like message logging.
        All observers are notified simultaneously.</p>

      <p>Observers SHOULD NOT modify the state of a channel except
        via user interaction.</p>

      <tp:rationale>
        <p>We want Observer UIs for file transfer channels (a progress
          bar for the transfer) to be able to have a Cancel button.</p>
      </tp:rationale>

      <p>Observers MUST NOT carry out actions that exactly one process
        must take responsibility for (e.g. acknowledging Text
        messages, or carrying out the actual transfer in a file transfer
        channel).</p>

      <tp:rationale>
        <p>Since arbitrarily many observers can be activated for
          each channel, it would not make sense for observers to do things
          that can only be done by one process (acknowledging
          <tp:dbus-ref
            namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Type">Text</tp:dbus-ref>
          messages, carrying out streaming for
          <tp:dbus-ref
            namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Type">StreamedMedia</tp:dbus-ref>
          channels, doing the actual data transfer for file transfers,
          setting up the out-of-band connection for Tubes). The
          <tp:dbus-ref
            namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client">Handler</tp:dbus-ref>
          is responsible for such tasks.</p>

        <p>Handlers MAY, of course, delegate responsibility for these
          tasks to other processes (including those run as observers),
          but this MUST be done explicitly via a request from the Handler
          to the Observer.</p>
      </tp:rationale>

      <p>Whenever a collection of new channels is signalled, the channel
        dispatcher will notify all running or activatable observers whose
        <tp:member-ref>ObserverChannelFilter</tp:member-ref> property
        (possibly as cached in the .client file) indicates that they are
        interested in some of the channels.</p>

      <p>Observers are activated for all channels in which they have
        registered an interest - incoming, outgoing or automatically created -
        although of course the ObserverChannelFilter property can be set
        to filter on the
        <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel">Requested</tp:dbus-ref>
        property.</p>

      <p>Because it might take time for an observer to become ready (for
        instance, a Text logger needs to wait until pending messages have been
        downloaded), the channel dispatcher must wait (up to some timeout) for
        all observers to return from
        <tp:member-ref>ObserveChannels</tp:member-ref> before letting anything
        destructive happen. Destructive things (e.g. acknowledging messages)
        are defined to be done by handlers, therefore HandleWith and Claim
        aren't allowed to succeed until all observers are ready.</p>
    </tp:docstring>

    <property name="ObserverChannelFilter"
      tp:name-for-bindings="Observer_Channel_Filter"
      type="aa{sv}" access="read" tp:type="Channel_Class[]">
      <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>A specification of the channels in which this observer is
          interested. The <tp:member-ref>ObserveChannels</tp:member-ref> method
          should be called by the channel dispatcher whenever any of the new
          channels in a <tp:dbus-ref
            namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Connection.Interface.Requests">NewChannels</tp:dbus-ref>
          signal match this description.</p>

        <p>Only certain D-Bus types have useful semantics for matching like this,
          so only certain types are allowed:</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Integers of all sizes, including byte (y, n, q, i, u, x, t)</dt>
          <dd>Matched by numeric value, regardless of type (e.g. 42 as a
            16-bit signed integer 'n' is considered equal to 42 as a 32-bit
            unsigned integer 'u')</dd>

          <dt>Booleans (b)</dt>
          <dd>Matched by equality in the obvious way; not considered equal to any
            other type</dd>

          <dt>Strings (s)</dt>
          <dd>Matched by equality in the obvious way; not considered equal to any
            other type</dd>

          <dt>Object paths (o)</dt>
          <dd>Matched by equality in the obvious way; not considered equal to any
            other type</dd>

        </dl>

        <p>This property never changes while the observer process owns its
          Client bus name. For activatable processes, the filter can change
          due to an upgrade - the channel dispatcher SHOULD observe changes to
          .client files using a mechanism like inotify.</p>

        <tp:rationale>
          <p>Not allowing this property to change is a simplification,
            particularly for activatable processes (we reject the possibility
            that a process with a .client file, when activated, has a filter
            that differs from what its .client file said).</p>

          <p>If an Observer wants to add extra channels to its list of
            interests at runtime, it can register an additional Client bus name
            (for instance, the org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client.Empathy process
            with unique name :1.42 could additionally register
            org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client.Empathy._1_42) with additional
            filters. To remove those filters, it can release the bus name;
            it could even re-claim the bus name immediately, with different
            filters.</p>

          <p>The same principle is applied to Approvers and Handlers.</p>
        </tp:rationale>

        <p>For observers that have a .client file, the channel dispatcher
          may discover this property from keys of the form
          <code><em>propertyname</em>/<em>type</em></code>,
          in groups in the .client file whose name is the name of this
          interface followed by <code>.ObserverChannelFilter</code>,
          a space and an ASCII decimal number starting from 0.</p>

        <p>Integers in the .client file are encoded in ASCII decimal, booleans
          are encoded as "true" or "false", and strings are encoded in the usual
          way for desktop files (including the C-style backslash escapes
          documented in the Desktop Entry specification).</p>

        <p>For instance, a .client file for an observer that is only interested
          in Text channels, with CONTACT or ROOM handles, that were requested by
          a local client:</p>

<pre>
[org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client]
Interfaces=org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client.Observer;

[org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client.Observer.ObserverChannelFilter 0]
org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Type s=org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Type.Text
org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.TargetHandleType u=1
org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Requested b=true

[org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client.Observer.ObserverChannelFilter 1]
org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Type s=org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Type.Text
org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.TargetHandleType u=2
org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Requested b=true
</pre>

    </property>

    <method name="ObserveChannels" tp:name-for-bindings="Observe_Channels">
      <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>Called by the channel dispatcher when channels in which the
          observer has registered an interest are announced in a <tp:dbus-ref
            namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Connection.Interface.Requests">NewChannels</tp:dbus-ref>
          signal.</p>

        <p>If the same NewChannels signal announces some channels that match
          the filter, and some that do not, then only a subset of the channels
          (those that do match the filter) are passed to this method.</p>

        <p>If the channel dispatcher will split up the channels from a single
          NewChannels signal and dispatch them separately (for instance
          because no installed Handler can handle all of them), it will call
          ObserveChannels several times.</p>

        <p>The observer MUST NOT return from this method call until it is ready
          for a handler for the channel to run (which may change the channel's
          state).</p>

        <tp:rationale>
          <p>The channel dispatcher must wait for observers to start up,
            to avoid the following race: text channel logger (observer) gets
            ObserveChannels, text channel handler gets
            <tp:dbus-ref
              namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client.Handler">HandleChannels</tp:dbus-ref>
            channel handler starts up faster and acknowledges messages,
            logger never sees those messages.</p>
        </tp:rationale>

        <p>The channel dispatcher SHOULD NOT change its behaviour based on
          whether this method succeeds or fails: there are no defined D-Bus
          errors for this method, and if it fails, this only indicates that
          an Observer is somehow broken.</p>

        <tp:rationale>
          <p>The expected error response in the channel dispatcher is to
            log a warning, and otherwise continue as though this method
            had succeeded.</p>
