      <p>Observers monitor the creation of new channels. This
        functionality can be used for things like message logging.
        All observers are notified simultaneously.</p>

      <p>Observers SHOULD NOT modify the state of a channel except
        via user interaction.</p>

      <tp:rationale>
        <p>We want Observer UIs for file transfer channels (a progress
          bar for the transfer) to be able to have a Cancel button.</p>
      </tp:rationale>

      <p>Observers MUST NOT carry out actions that exactly one process
        must take responsibility for (e.g. acknowledging Text
        messages, or carrying out the actual transfer in a file transfer
        channel).</p>

      <tp:rationale>
        <p>Since arbitrarily many observers can be activated for
          each channel, it would not make sense for observers to do things
          that can only be done by one process (acknowledging
          <tp:dbus-ref
            namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Type">Text</tp:dbus-ref>
          messages, carrying out streaming for
          <tp:dbus-ref
            namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Type">StreamedMedia</tp:dbus-ref>
          channels, doing the actual data transfer for file transfers,
          setting up the out-of-band connection for Tubes). The
          <tp:dbus-ref
            namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client">Handler</tp:dbus-ref>
          is responsible for such tasks.</p>

        <p>Handlers MAY, of course, delegate responsibility for these
          tasks to other processes (including those run as observers),
          but this MUST be done explicitly via a request from the Handler
          to the Observer.</p>
      </tp:rationale>

      <p>Whenever new channels are signalled, the channel dispatcher
        will notify all running or activatable observers whose
        <tp:member-ref>ObserverChannelFilter</tp:member-ref> property
        (possibly as cached in the .client file) indicates that they are
        interested in the channel.</p>

      <p>Observers are activated for all channels in which they have
        registered an interest - incoming, outgoing or automatically created -
        although of course the ObserverChannelFilter property can be set
        to filter on the
        <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel">Requested</tp:dbus-ref>
        property.</p>
    </tp:docstring>

    <property name="ObserverChannelFilter"
      tp:name-for-bindings="Observer_Channel_Filter"
      type="aa{sv}" access="read" tp:type="Channel_Class[]">
      <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>A specification of the channels in which this observer is
          interested. The <tp:member-ref>ObserveChannels</tp:member-ref> method
          should be called by the channel dispatcher whenever any of the new
          channels in a NewChannels signal match this description.</p>

        <p>(FIXME: open issue: do we want this, and the corresponding
          Approver and Handler properties, to be able to change at
          runtime?)</p>

        <p>Only certain D-Bus types have useful semantics for matching like this,
          so only certain types are allowed:</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Integers of all sizes, including byte (y, n, q, i, u, x, t)</dt>
          <dd>Matched by numeric value, regardless of type (e.g. 42 as a
            16-bit signed integer 'n' is considered equal to 42 as a 32-bit
            unsigned integer 'u')</dd>

          <dt>Booleans (b)</dt>
          <dd>Matched by equality in the obvious way; not considered equal to any
            other type</dd>

          <dt>Strings (s)</dt>
          <dd>Matched by equality in the obvious way; not considered equal to any
            other type</dd>

          <dt>Object paths (o)</dt>
          <dd>Matched by equality in the obvious way; not considered equal to any
            other type</dd>

        </dl>

        <p>This property never changes while the observer process is
          running. For activatable processes, the filter can change due to an
          upgrade - the channel dispatcher SHOULD observe changes to .client files
          using a mechanism like inotify.</p>

        <p>For observers that have a .client file, the channel dispatcher
          may discover this property from keys of the form
          <code><em>propertyname</em>/<em>type</em></code>,
          in groups in the .client file whose name is the name of this
          interface followed by <code>.ObserverChannelFilter</code>,
          a space and an ASCII decimal number starting from 0.</p>

        <p>Integers in the .client file are encoded in ASCII decimal, booleans
          are encoded as "true" or "false", and strings are encoded in the usual
          way for desktop files (including the C-style backslash escapes
          documented in the Desktop Entry specification).</p>

        <p>For instance, a .client file for an observer that is only interested
          in Text channels, with CONTACT or ROOM handles, that were requested by
          a local client:</p>
