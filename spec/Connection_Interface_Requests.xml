          <p>Connection managers MUST NOT include properties in this mapping
            if their values can change. Clients MUST ignore properties
            that appear in this mapping if their values can change.</p>

          <tp:rationale>
            <p>If properties that could change were included, the following
              race condition would be likely to exist in some cases:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>NewChannels or Get("Channels") includes a property P with
                value V1</li>
              <li>Client creates a proxy object for the channel</li>
              <li>The value of P changes to V2</li>
              <li>Client connects to PChanged signal</li>
              <li>Client should call Get("P") or GetAll here, to avoid the
                race, but client's author has forgotten to do so</li>
              <li>Proxy object thinks P == V1, but actually P == V2</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We've taken the opportunity to make the API encourage the
              client author to get it right. Where possible, we intend that
              properties whose value will be used in channel dispatching
              or other "early" processing will be defined so that they are
              immutable (can never change).</p>

            Some properties

        <tp:rationale>
          <p>This will often just be the channel type and the handle type,
            but can include other properties of the channel - for instance,

        <tp:rationale>
          <p>For older clients to still be able to understand how to request

            we'd need to represent it like this:</p>

          <p>This implies that connection managers wishing to make channels
            available to old or minimal clients SHOULD have a channel class
            with the minimum number of Fixed_Properties, and MAY additionally

              Clients are expected to understand the documented relationship

            channels with that property in a request, or added to an existing

            unable to mark channels of this class as part of a bundle - this
            means that to the remote contact they are likely to be
